# 1. Record architecture decisions

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

- We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).
- We will implement this using Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) for managing our ADRs.

## Consequences

The team will use ADRs in this directory and format for all future, significant architecture decisions. This will:
- Provide a clear record of why architectural decisions were made
- Make it easier for new team members to understand the project's evolution
- Ensure architectural decisions are properly documented and traceable
- Create a single source of truth for architectural decisions
- Help maintain consistency in how we document and communicate architectural changes
