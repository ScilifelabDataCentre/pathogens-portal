## The Swedish COVID-19 & Pandemic Preparedness Data Portal

This is the source code for the Swedish COVID-19 & Pandemic Preparedness Data Portal:
[https://www.covid19dataportal.se/](https://www.covid19dataportal.se/)

The website is the Swedish node for the European Covid-19 Data Portal project.
The main European site can be seen at [https://www.covid19dataportal.org/](https://www.covid19dataportal.org/)

## Introduction

This website is developed and maintained by the [SciLifeLab Data Centre](https://www.scilifelab.se/data/) with many contributions from collaborators. Contributions from anyone are welcome and will be published after a review by the Portal team.

The website is intended to provide a central place to provide information about:

- Available open research datasets relevant for COVID-19 and other topics within pandemic preparedness research
- Support services for researchers working on COVID-19 and other topics within pandemic preparedness research
- Information and support for publishing and sharing datasets on COVID-19 and other topics within pandemic preparedness research
- Ongoing research projects and funding opportunities for COVID-19 and other topics within pandemic preparedness research

The site is built using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static web site generator.
It uses the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework. In addition, it uses [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/), [DataTables](https://datatables.net/), [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/), [plotly](https://plotly.com/), [ImJoy](https://imjoy.io/) for various features.


## Development and contributions

### Adding and editing information in different sections

We prepared detailed instructions on how to add or edit information in each specific section of the portal, see [the page on adding and editing information in the CONTRIBUTING folder](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/covid-portal/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING/adding_editing_information.md).

### Testing changes with a local copy of the portal

Users who are technically more advanced are welcome to make contributions by running a local copy of the portal on their own computers, we prepared [instructions on how to do that here](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/covid-portal/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING/running_a_local_copy.md).

### Using ImJoy Plugins

This website supports [ImJoy](https://imjoy.io) plugins which can be used to visualize, annotate, run analysis directly from the website. See [an example here](https://covid19dataportal.se/highlights/immunofluorescence/). Please see the file [CONTRIBUTING/ImJoy.md](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/covid-portal/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING/ImJoy.md) for examples of usage.
