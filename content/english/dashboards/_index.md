The *Dashboards* section describes research done on a given subject relevant to pandemic preparedness research by researchers affiliated with a Swedish research institute. Specifically, in our case we write about COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2, infectious diseases in general, antibiotic resistance, enteric virus and Mpox. The goal is to highlight and visualise openly shared data that can potentially be used by many other researchers to make further discoveries.
