Data dashboards are **pages that promote data and other research resources developed by projects involving Swedish researchers or institutes**. The dashboards provide context for the resource, and usually dynamic data visualisations.

The dashboards are sorted according to when they were last updated, with the most recently updated shown first. All dashboards will be shown by default. Click on **Updating** to view only dashboards where data are still being updated. Click on **Historic** to see dashboards that include only historic data. To see dashboards relevant to a specific **topic**, click on the corresponding coloured topic tag at the bottom of the card (e.g. 'COVID-19', 'Infectious diseases', 'Influenza').
