## General information on COVID-19 vaccines

The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged societies and healthcare systems worldwide. In response, vaccines and therapeautic treatments have been rapidly developed. New vaccines are developed regularly, and are reviewed by EMA. Please refer to EMA's page on [COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/overview/public-health-threats/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/treatments-vaccines/covid-19-vaccines) to see the latest information on which vaccine are approved, which have submitted marketing authorisation, and which are under rolling review. New vaccines remain under rolling review until EMA have reviewed clinical trial data and determined that there is sufficient evidence to enable developers to apply for marketing authorisation.
