<div class="alert alert-info"><b>Please note:</b> the wastewater dashboard is undergoing expansion over the next few months. We have now separated the data related to the amount of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater according to the research group that collected and analysed the data (see below for information about the groups involved). In the coming months, more information and data will be added about SARS-CoV-2 and on other infectious diseases. </span></div>

## Introduction

Wastewater surveillance could prove to be an effective system for monitoring COVID-19 prevalence and act as an early-warning system for predicting upcoming outbreaks. See below for [a general introduction to wastewater epidemiology](#background-wastewater-based-epidemiology).

This dashboard presents wastewater epidemiology data from various Swedish cities. The cities included here have a total population of over 3 million people. The data presented in this dashboard originates from analyses conducted by the two laboratories involved in [SEEC (The Swedish Environmental Epidemiology Center)](https://www.scilifelab.se/pandemic-response/pandemic-laboratory-preparedness/swedish-environmental-epidemiology-center-seec/). SEEC was established as a pandemic laboratory preparedness resource project within [SciLifeLab’s Pandemic Preparedness Program](https://www.scilifelab.se/pandemic-response). Samples have been analysed in two nodes of SEEC:

- **SEEC-SLU:** Samples from multiple sites, including Uppsala, Örebro, and Umeå, among others, are analysed at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences node led by associate professor Anna J. Székely (anna.szekely@slu.se) and associate professor Maja Malmberg (maja.malmberg@slu.se).

- **SEEC-KTH:** Samples from Stockholm and Malmö are analysed at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology node led by associate professor Zeynep Cetecioglu Gurol (zeynepcg@kth.se).

Note that there are slight differences between the methods of the two laboratories that must be considered when comparing the data generated by a different laboratory. To correct for variations in population size and wastewater flow, both groups quantify the pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) using a modified version of the assay of [Zhang *et al.* (2006)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0040003). PMMoV is an abundant RNA virus in human feces and serves as an estimator of human fecal content ([Symonds *et al.*, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007639)). However, for the quantification of SARS-CoV-2, the SEEC-SLU laboratory uses the SARS-CoV-2 specific [N1 assay from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/rt-pcr-panel-primer-probes.html), while the SEEC-KTH laboratory uses the SARS-like virus specific N3-primers ([Lu *et al.*, 2020](https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2608.201246)) with SYBR Green chemistry ([Perez-Zabaleta *et al.*, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160023)). Furthermore, differences in the wastewater collection systems and populations of different cities might bias the direct comparison between cities measured even with the same method.

## Map of sample collection sites

Below is a map showing sample collection sites. Approximate locations of the wastewater treatment plants are given, where possible. Otherwise, the location of the city itself is given.

## Background: Wastewater-based epidemiology

SARS-CoV-2 virus genome can be detected in feces samples from COVID-19 patients using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (see, for example, [Wu *et al*. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-1253(20)30083-2)). Monitoring of SARS CoV-2 virus levels in wastewater from communities could therefore provide early surveillance of disease prevalence at a population-wide level, referred to as wastewater-based epidemiology ([Corpuz *et al.*, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140910)).

Wastewater-based epidemiology studies the amount of virus genome present in the wastewater, measured using PCR technology. Wastewater, also referred to as “sewage,” includes water from multiple sources in households, including kitchen sinks, toilets, and showers. However, it could also include water from other sources (for example, rainwater and water from industrial use). Samples used for wastewater epidemiology studies are periodically taken at wastewater treatment facilities, enabling assessments of viral load over time. It has previously been shown that the SARS CoV-2 virus content in wastewater can predict increases in infection in the population and follows the epidemic trend measured by the number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalisation rate (see [Peccia *et al.* (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-020-0684-z)). During the COVID-19 pandemic, surveillance of viral RNA levels in wastewater has been increasingly used to monitor and predict the spread of the disease.

Please note that the graphs presented in the different sections of this dashboard are based on preliminary data which is yet to be fully evaluated. The data shared should therefore be used with caution. Note also that, because different sample collection and data analysis methods are used in different research projects, it is not possible to make comparisons of viral load across these projects (e.g. between locations measured in different projects). Comparisons should only be made between measurements taken in the same project, as the methodology remains consistent.

Wastewater monitoring should primarily be seen as a surveillance system. Taken together with data for infection testing, intensive care admissions etc., it may help in understanding the regional dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic.
