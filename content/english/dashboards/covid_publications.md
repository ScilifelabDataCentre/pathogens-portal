The visualisations on this page evaluate the development of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 research across the Netherlands by assessing publication output. Specifically, we consider multiple aspects of journal publications and preprints where at least one author has an affiliation with a Dutch research institute. The database containing the publications themselves [can be found on this page](/publications/). Note that our database is manually curated and, as such, may not be exhaustive. The full database sorted by publication date is available on [Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%28%28COVID-19%29+OR+%28SARS-CoV-2%29%29+AND+%28Netherlands%5BAffiliation%5D%29&sort=date).
