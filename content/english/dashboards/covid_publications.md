The visualisations on this page evaluate the development of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 research across the Netherlands by assessing publication output. Specifically, we consider multiple aspects of journal publications and preprints where at least one author has an affiliation with a Dutch research institute. The database containing the publications themselves [can be found on this page](/publications/).
