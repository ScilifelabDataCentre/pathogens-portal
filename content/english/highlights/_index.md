The *Data Highlights* section showcases recently published datasets relevant to pandemic preparedness research by researchers affiliated with a Swedish research institute. Specifically, in our case we write about COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2, infectious diseases in general, and antibiotic resistance. The goal is to highlight openly shared data that can potentially be used by many other researchers to make further discoveries.
