COVID-19 infection is most commonly tested using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), but RNA purification constitutes a logistically demanding and costly prerequisite for conventional RT-PCR based diagnostics. To accommodate expansion of COVID-19 testing, researchers at the Karolinska Institute (PI: Björn Reinius; first authors; Ioanna Smyrlaki, Martin Ekman) developed a simple, cheap, and RNA extraction-free RT-PCR-based test, retaining high accuracy in identifying positive and negative cases. The method has broad implications to simplify COVID-19 testing within as well as outside health-care-facility settings and for periodic testing of asymptomatic people, benefitting patient care and infection control.

From start, the researchers continuously shared their results on the medRxiv.org pre-print server (first version April 17th 2020), gaining considerable attention. Data from the paper is freely available on [*Nature Communications*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18611-5) and computational code is openly provided at [github.com/reiniuslab/COVID19](https://github.com/reiniuslab/COVID19).
