This section presents a list of current and upcoming funding opportunities by large funding agencies relevant to researchers in Sweden who work on COVID-19, infectious diseases, and antibiotic resistance. We focus on topic-specific calls but general funding calls for medicine and health as well as life science grants are listed as well. For a list of recurring funding calls, see [the text below](#recurring-funding-opportunities).

This list is manually curated so it is possible that some calls are not listed. If you would like for a call to be listed here, please click the button below and fill in the short form.

## Recurring funding opportunities

Generally, the Swedish Research Council starts accepting applications for funding within medicine and health (such as for example the project grant, starting grant and consolidator grant) at the beginning of each year  with a deadline in spring. Information about these calls is typically available at the end of the previous year.

Generally, Svenska Sällskapet för Medicinsk Forskning (SSMF) grant applications are accepted during spring. You can find information about [funding from SSMF on their website](https://www.ssmf.se/for-scientists/).
