This section presents a list of current and upcoming funding opportunities by large funding agencies relevant to researchers in Sweden who work on COVID-19, infectious diseases, and antibiotic resistance. We focus on topic-specific calls but general funding calls for medicine and health as well as life science grants are listed as well. NB: This list is manually curated so it is possible that some calls are not listed. If you would like for a call to be listed here, please send us an email to datacentre@scilifelab.se. For a list of recurring funding calls, see [the text below](#recurring-funding-opportunities).
