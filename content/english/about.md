### Introduction

<figure class="figure float-right"><img width="500" src="/img/logos/scilifelab-logo.svg"></figure>

The Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal provides information, guidelines, tools and services to support researchers to utilise Swedish and European infrastructures for data sharing, in particular the [European COVID-19 Data Portal](https://covid19dataportal.org). It is regularly updated with new services, tools and data. Suggestions, corrections or other comments are most welcome.

The Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal is operated by the [SciLifeLab Data Centre](https://scilifelab.se/data/) and partners.

This website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and uses the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework. In addition, we make use of [Vega/Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) for interactive graphics,  [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) and [Select2](https://select2.org/) plugins for jQuery. The code is open source ([MIT licence](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)) and is available on [GitHub: github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/covid-portal](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/covid-portal)

We welcome contributions to the website - to get involved, please contact [datacentre@scilifelab.se](mailto:datacentre@scilifelab.se).

### People behind the portal

Many people from SciLifeLab, NBIS, and other organisations were involved in the initial development and content creation for the Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal. An incomplete list of contributors [can be found on Github](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/covid-portal/graphs/contributors). Since September 2020, the content of the portal is managed by a dedicated team at the [SciLifeLab Data Center](https://scilifelab.se/data/). We are happy to answer your questions about data availability, data sharing, data management and all related issues; just send us an email.

### Organisations behind the portal

The Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal is operated by the [SciLifeLab Data Centre](https://www.scilifelab.se/data) and partners. The [Swedish Research Council](https://vr.se) is responsible for coordination with the European initiative.

SciLifeLab and the Swedish Research Council are committed to the open sharing of data and results, and have both signed the Wellcome Trust statement on [Sharing research data and findings relevant to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak](https://wellcome.ac.uk/coronavirus-covid-19/open-data).

##### SciLifeLab

[https://www.scilifelab.se](https://www.scilifelab.se)

SciLifeLab, Science for Life Laboratory, is an institution for the advancement of molecular biosciences in Sweden. We are funded as a national research infrastructure by the Swedish government. Our organization leverages the unique strengths of individual researchers across Sweden into a focused resource for the life science community. We provide access for thousands of researchers to the cutting-edge instrumentation and deep scientific expertise necessary to be internationally competitive in bioscience research. This infrastructure is supported and developed by our research community, including internationally recognized experts in life science and technology. Our facilities and expertise create a unique environment for carrying out health and environmental research at the highest level.

SciLifeLab started out in 2010 as a joint effort between four universities: [Karolinska Institutet](https://www.ki.se/), [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/), [Stockholm University](https://www.su.se/) and [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/). Today, we support research activities at all major Swedish universities.

##### SciLifeLab Data Centre

[https://www.scilifelab.se/data/](https://www.scilifelab.se/data/)

Life science research is increasingly becoming not only technology-driven, but also data-driven. SciLifeLab coordinates and supports activities throughout the life cycle of data, from project planning, data production, data analysis, data sharing, to publishing and reuse of data, where researchers are dependent on advanced data analysis and e-infrastructures.

Our focus is on data arising from the use of SciLifeLab infrastructure platforms, both to promote research on adding value to data, research deriving biological knowledge from data, and infrastructure making data findable and available. At SciLifeLab, we see data as one of the most valuable and long-lasting products of our operations and strive to make our data [FAIR](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples), handled according to open science standards and that its long- term value to the scientific community is maximized.

##### National Bioinformatics Infrastructure

[https://nbis.se](https://nbis.se)

NBIS (National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden) is a distributed national research infrastructure supported by the Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsrådet), Science for Life Laboratory, all major Swedish universities and the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, providing state-of-the-art bioinformatics to the Swedish life science researchers community. NBIS is also the Swedish contact point to the European infrastructure for biological information [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org/).

##### Swedish National Data Service

[https://snd.gu.se](https://snd.gu.se)

The Swedish National Data Service has a primary function to support the accessibility, preservation, and re-use of research data and related materials. As a national infrastructure, SND coordinates a network of more than 30 universities and public research institutes in Sweden. SND is certified data repository and provides services for researchers to share and access research data from all research areas.
