### Introduction

<figure class="figure float-right"><img width="300" src="/img/logos/scilifelab-logo.svg"></figure>

The *Swedish COVID-19 & Pandemic Preparedness Data Portal* provides information about available datasets, resources, tools and services to support researchers working on topics relevant to pandemic preparedness in all Swedish research institutions in data-related questions.

The Portal is operated by the [SciLifeLab Data Centre](https://scilifelab.se/data/) and partners with the aim to serve all researchers in Sweden working on topics relevant to pandemic preparedness. We welcome community contributions to the Portal and [provide different ways to contribute](/contribute/). In addition to running the Portal, the team can also either [provide support on data-related questions or help find suitable support services](/support/).

This website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) in combination with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling, [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) for tables, [Vega/Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) for interactive graphics. The code is open source ([MIT licence](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)) and [is available on GitHub](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/covid-portal). Re-use of the website code or contributions to the website code are welcome.

### History of the Portal

The Portal was launched in June 2020 [on assignment and with funding from the Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsrådet)](https://www.vr.se/english/just-now/news/news-archive/2020-06-03-new-national-portal-makes-research-data-on-covid-19-accessible.html). The Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal became the first national node of the [European COVID-19 Data Platform](https://covid19dataportal.eu/) which in turn was [initiated and funded by the European Commission](https://www.embl.org/news/science/embl-ebi-launches-covid-19-data-portal/) (you can find an [overview of other national nodes here](/partners/)). We wrote a summary of what happened on the Portal during its first year [in this news item](/updates/first_year/). The Portal focused on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 research data exclusively until the end of 2021.

From 2022, the Portal expanded to cover other research relevant to pandemic preparedness and became a part of the [SciLifeLab Pandemic Laboratory Preparedness programme](https://www.scilifelab.se/pandemic-response/pandemic-laboratory-preparedness/). The SciLifeLab Pandemic Laboratory Preparedness Programme is funded by the earmarked governmental funding to SciLifeLab ([Research proposition Prop. 202/21:60](https://www.regeringen.se/rattsliga-dokument/proposition/2020/12/forskning-frihet-framtid--kunskap-och-innovation-for-sverige/)).

From the start, the Portal is operated by the [SciLifeLab Data Centre](https://scilifelab.se/data/) and partners with a considerable amount of community input. Many people have contributed to building the initial and subsequent versions of the Portal by writing the website code or contributing with content. An overview of some of the early and recent contributors [can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/covid-portal/graphs/contributors).

### People behind the Portal

Many people from SciLifeLab, NBIS, and other organisations were involved in the initial and subsequent development and content creation for the Portal. An incomplete list of contributors [can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/covid-portal/graphs/contributors). The current team actively working on the Portal can be found below. We are happy to help you with using the Portal, discuss your suggestions about existing and new sections and content as well as answer your questions about data availability, data sharing, data management and all related issues; just send us an email.

### Organisations behind the Portal

##### SciLifeLab

[scilifelab.se](https://www.scilifelab.se)

SciLifeLab, Science for Life Laboratory, is an institution for the advancement of molecular biosciences in Sweden. We are funded as a national research infrastructure by the Swedish government. Our organization leverages the unique strengths of individual researchers across Sweden into a focused resource for the life science community. We provide access for thousands of researchers to the cutting-edge instrumentation and deep scientific expertise necessary to be internationally competitive in bioscience research. This infrastructure is supported and developed by our research community, including internationally recognized experts in life science and technology. Our facilities and expertise create a unique environment for carrying out health and environmental research at the highest level.

SciLifeLab started out in 2010 as a joint effort between four universities: [Karolinska Institutet](https://www.ki.se/), [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/), [Stockholm University](https://www.su.se/) and [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/). Today, we support research activities at all major Swedish universities.

##### SciLifeLab Data Centre

[scilifelab.se/data/](https://www.scilifelab.se/data/)

Life science research is increasingly becoming not only technology-driven, but also data-driven. SciLifeLab coordinates and supports activities throughout the life cycle of data, from project planning, data production, data analysis, data sharing, to publishing and reuse of data, where researchers are dependent on advanced data analysis and e-infrastructures.

Our focus is on data arising from the use of SciLifeLab infrastructure platforms, both to promote research on adding value to data, research deriving biological knowledge from data, and infrastructure making data findable and available. At SciLifeLab, we see data as one of the most valuable and long-lasting products of our operations and strive to make our data [FAIR](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples), handled according to open science standards and that its long- term value to the scientific community is maximized.

<figure class="figure float-right mx-3"><img height="40" alt="BY-COVID logo" src="/img/logos/by-covid-logo.svg"></figure>

The Swedish COVID-19 & Pandemic Preparedness Data Portal is one of the partners in the [BY-COVID consortium](https://by-covid.org/). BY-COVID is [funded by the European Comission](https://by-covid.org/news-events/by-covid-launch/) and brings together [53 partners from 19 countries](https://by-covid.org/about) and stakeholders from the biomedical field, hospitals, public health, social sciences and humanities.

The BeYond-COVID project aims to make COVID-19 data accessible to scientists in laboratories but also to anyone who can use it, such as medical staff in hospitals or government officials. Going beyond SARS-CoV-2 data, the project will provide a framework for making data from other infectious diseases open and accessible to everyone. The project will integrate established national and European infrastructures with ELIXIR, BBMRI, ECRIN, PHIRI and CESSDA. It will build on existing efforts, such as the COVID-19 Data Platform and the Versatile Emerging infectious disease Observatory project (VEO), maximising efficiency. It will also develop synergies with the European Health Data Space.
