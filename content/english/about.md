### Introduction

The *Swedish COVID-19 & Pandemic Preparedness Data Portal* provides information about available datasets, resources, tools, and services related to pandemic preparedness in Sweden. We offer support to all those involved in pandemic preparedness research that are affiliated with a Swedish research institution or university.

The Portal is operated by the [SciLifeLab Data Centre](https://scilifelab.se/data/) and partners (please see below). We welcome community contributions to the Portal and [provide information on the different ways that the community can contribute](/contribute/). In addition to running the Portal, the team can also either [provide support on data-related questions surrounding pandemic preparedness research or help find suitable support services](/support/). For more general data support, please see our [related research data management service](data-guidelines.scilifelab.se).

This website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) in combination with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling, [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) for tables, and [Vega/Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) for interactive graphics. All code used for the Portal is open source (held under an [MIT licence](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)) and [is available on GitHub](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/covid-portal). We encourage the reuse of our code, either for generating another national portal, or recreating certain features.

### Organisations and programs behind the Portal

##### [Pandemic Laboratory Preparedness (PLP) Program](https://www.scilifelab.se/capabilities/pandemic-laboratory-preparedness/)

<figure class="figure float-right mx-3"><img height="150" alt="PLP logo" src="/img/plp_default2.png"></figure>

SciLifeLab (Science for Life Laboratory) was [commissioned by the Swedish govenment](https://www.regeringen.se/rattsliga-dokument/proposition/2020/12/forskning-frihet-framtid--kunskap-och-innovation-for-sverige/) to prepare resources and capabilities that can be used to deal with future pandemics. The assignment broadly involved supporting research related to infectious diseases (e.g. in diagnostics, analysis of infection, immunity, and the development of resistance to therapies in pathogens), and building competence and developing technologies related to pandemic research (e.g. in sequencing, genetic analysis, immunology, and big data).

The [Pandemic Laboratory Preparedness (PLP) program](https://www.scilifelab.se/capabilities/pandemic-laboratory-preparedness/) was established as a result of the commission from the government in December 2020. The services, tools, and resources (termed ‘capabilities’) established through the PLP program are intended to complement those established elsewhere in society (e.g. authorities, municipalities and regions) when tackling future pandemics. As such, the PLP program will work closely with governmental agencies, e.g. [Swedish Public Health Agency (FoHM)](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se).

The first call from the PLP program was released in February 2021. The first eight capabilities were selected for support in July 2021. The program now supports over 20 capabilities and technology development projects, with more expected in 2023.

To see more about the PLP program and the capabilities resulting from it, see our ['pandemic preparedness resources' page](https://www.covid19dataportal.se/resources/).

##### [SciLifeLab](https://www.scilifelab.se)

<figure class="figure float-right"><img width="300" src="/img/logos/scilifelab-logo.svg"></figure>

SciLifeLab (Science for Life Laboratory) is an institution for the advancement of molecular biosciences in Sweden. We are funded as a national research infrastructure by the Swedish government. Our organisation leverages the unique strengths of individual researchers across Sweden into a focused resource for the life science community. Thousands of researchers rely on us to provide access to the cutting-edge instrumentation and deep scientific expertise needed to produce internationally competitive bioscience research. These technologies are supported and developed by our research community, which includes internationally recognised experts in life science and technology. Our facilities and expertise create a unique environment for carrying out health and environmental research at the highest level.

SciLifeLab began in 2010 as a joint effort between four Swedish universities ([Karolinska Institutet](https://www.ki.se/), [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/), [Stockholm University](https://www.su.se/) and [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/)). However, today we have expanded far beyond this, and support research activities at all major Swedish universities.

##### [SciLifeLab Data Centre](https://www.scilifelab.se/data/)

<figure class="figure float-right mx-3"><img height="110" alt="SciLifeLab Data Centre logo" src="/img/logos/dc_branding_light_bg.svg"></figure>

Life science research is increasingly becoming data-driven, rather than primarily technology-driven. SciLifeLab coordinates and supports activities throughout the data life cycle, from project planning and data production, right through to  data publishing and reuse, where researchers are dependent on advanced data analysis and e-infrastructures.

At SciLifeLab, we see data as one of the most valuable and long-lasting products of our operations. We strive to ensure our data adheres to the principles of [FAIR](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples) and Open Science. We also put considerable effort into maximising the long-term value of our data to the scientific community.

### Partner organisations

##### [The European COVID-19 Data Platform](https://covid19dataportal.org/)

<figure class="figure float-right mx-3"><img height="50" alt="The European COVID-19 Data Platform logo" src="/img/logos/european_covid19dataportal.svg"></figure>

The COVID-19 & Pandemic Preparedness Data Portal is a national node of the [European COVID-19 Data Platform](https://www.covid19dataportal.org/). The European COVID-19 Data Platform is operated by the [European Bioinformatics Institute](https://ebi.ac.uk) (a part of the [European Molecular Biology Laboratory](https://www.embl.org/) (EMBL-EBI)), together with the European Commission, and other research partners, such as ELIXIR. An overview of other national nodes [can be found here](/partners/).

The European COVID-19 Data Platform aims to facilitate data sharing and analysis in order to accelerate coronavirus research. It enables researchers to upload, access and analyse reference data and specialist datasets related to COVID-19. It is synchronised with COVID-19-related data and scientific literature held in EMBL-EBI's data resources, including ENA, UniProt, PDBe, EMDB, Expression Atlas and Europe PMC. The data continues to grow in diversity and volume, but include sequences, structures, expression data, compound screens, biochemistries and scientific publications.

##### [BY-COVID consortium](https://by-covid.org/)

<figure class="figure float-right mx-3"><img height="40" alt="BY-COVID logo" src="/img/logos/by-covid-logo.svg"></figure>

The Swedish COVID-19 & Pandemic Preparedness Data Portal is one of the partners in the [BY-COVID consortium](https://by-covid.org/). BY-COVID is a Horizon project [funded by the European Comission](https://by-covid.org/news-events/by-covid-launch/) and brings together [53 partners from 19 countries](https://by-covid.org/about). Stakeholders include individuals and organisation from multiple areas, including the biomedical field, hospitals, public health, social sciences and humanities.

The BeYond-COVID (BY-COVID) project aims to make COVID-19 data accessible to anyone that can use it, including medical staff in hospitals, researchers in labs, and government officials. The project will provide a framework for making data from other infectious diseases open and accessible to everyone. The project will integrate established national and European infrastructures with ELIXIR, BBMRI, ECRIN, PHIRI and CESSDA. It will build on existing efforts, such as the COVID-19 Data Platform and the Versatile Emerging infectious disease Observatory project (VEO), in order to maximise efficiency. It will also develop synergies with the European Health Data Space.

Members of the Portal team are involved in the development of the [Infectious Disease Toolkit](https://www.infectious-diseases-toolkit.org), a major deliverable of the BY-COVID project.

##### [National Bioinformatics Infrastructure (NBIS) and ELIXIR Sweden](https://nbis.se)

<figure class="figure float-right mx-3"><img height="80" alt="National Bioinformatics Infrastructure (NBIS) logo" src="/img/logos/nbislogo-orange-txt.svg"></figure>

<figure class="figure float-right mx-3"><img height="80" alt="ELIXIR logo" src="/img/logos/elixir-se-logo.png"></figure>

NBIS (National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden) is a distributed national research infrastructure supported by the Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsrådet), Science for Life Laboratory, all major Swedish universities, and the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation. It provides state-of-the-art bioinformatics to the life science research community in Sweden. NBIS is also the Swedish contact point to the European infrastructure for biological information, [ELIXIR Europe](https://www.elixir-europe.org/).

### History of the Portal

The Swedish COVID-19 & Pandemic Preparedness Portal was launched in June 2020 [on assignment and with funding from the Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsrådet)](https://www.vr.se/english/just-now/news/news-archive/2020-06-03-new-national-portal-makes-research-data-on-covid-19-accessible.html). The Portal was actually the first national node of the [European COVID-19 Data Platform](https://covid19dataportal.eu/), which was [initiated and funded by the European Commission](https://www.embl.org/news/science/embl-ebi-launches-covid-19-data-portal/) (you can find an [overview of other national nodes here](/partners/)). The Portal focused on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 research data exclusively until the end of 2021. We released a [news item](/updates/first_year/) summarising our activities in 2021.

From 2022, the Portal expanded to cover other research relevant to pandemic preparedness and became a part of the [SciLifeLab Pandemic Laboratory Preparedness programme](https://www.scilifelab.se/pandemic-response/pandemic-laboratory-preparedness/). The SciLifeLab Pandemic Laboratory Preparedness Programme is funded by the earmarked governmental funding to SciLifeLab ([Research proposition Prop. 202/21:60](https://www.regeringen.se/rattsliga-dokument/proposition/2020/12/forskning-frihet-framtid--kunskap-och-innovation-for-sverige/)).

From the start, the Portal has been operated by the [SciLifeLab Data Centre](https://scilifelab.se/data/) and partners. However, it has received considerable input from the community. Indeed, many people contributed to building the initial site, and to content throughout. An overview of some of the contributors that have instrumental to establishing and advancing the Portal [can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/covid-portal/graphs/contributors).

### People behind the Portal

Many people from SciLifeLab, NBIS, other organisations, and the community have been involved in the Portal since its conception in early 2020. An incomplete list of contributors [can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/covid-portal/graphs/contributors). Below, we show the current team of people actively working on the Portal.

The team are happy to help with using the Portal, to take suggestions regarding new and existing sections, and to answer any questions that you may have. Please just [get in touch](/contact/).
