## Published Data

#### General useful data sources

Imaging data at the EMBL-EBI:

* [BioImage Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/bioimage-archive/) -  stores and distributes biological images that are useful to life-science researchers currently in development. In its first phase, the BioImage Archive will provide archiving services to EMPIAR. Image data currently in BioStudies will also be migrated to the BioImage Archive, whilst new direct image-data submissions will be accepted by BioStudies, Cell-IDR or Tissue-IDR.

* [Electron Microscopy Public Image Archive(EMPIAR)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/emdb/empiar/) - public resource for raw electron microscopy images. Here, you can browse, upload and download the raw images used to build a 3D structure.
