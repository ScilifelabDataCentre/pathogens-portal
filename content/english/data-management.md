"Research data management concerns the organization, storage, preservation, and sharing of data that is collected or analysed during a research project. Proper planning and management of research data will make project management easier and more efficient while projects are being performed. It also facilitates sharing and allows others to validate as well as reuse the data. Also, funding agencies are recognizing the importance of research data management and some now request Data Management Plans (DMP) as part of the grant application process." ([NBIS](https://www.nbis.se/infrastructure/data-management/dm-introduction.html))

Here we give an overview of available resources regarding research data management relevant to Swedish researchers working on COVID-19 and Pandemic Preparedness research.

## Data management resources

### National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden (NBIS) and SciLifeLab Data Centre

![NBIS Logo](/img/logos/nbislogo-orange-txt.svg#floatright)

- [A Brief Introduction to Data Management](https://www.nbis.se/infrastructure/data-management/dm-introduction.html)
- [ENA submission guidelines](/support_services/tutorial_ena/tutorial_ena_intro/) - guidance developed to aid submissions to the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)
- [SciLifeLab Data Guidelines](https://scilifelab-data-guidelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/index.html) - data type specific guidelines for good data management practices
- [SciLifeLab Data Stewardship Wizard, DSW](http://dsw.scilifelab.se/) - a customised tool for creating Data Management Plans (DMPs) with templates conforming to the requirements of the Swedish Research Council and other stakeholders
- [SciLifeLab Data Management helpdesk](mailto:data-management@scilifelab.se) - data stewards from NBIS and SciLifeLab Data Centre are available to discuss and provide support regarding data management questions

### ELIXIR Research Data Management Kit (RDMkit)

![SND logo](/img/logos/rdmkit_logo.png#floatright)

The [ELIXIR Research Data Management Kit (RDMkit)](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/) is an online guide containing good data management practices applicable to research projects from the beginning to the end. Developed and managed by people who work every day with life science data, the RDMkit has guidelines, information, and pointers to help you with problems throughout the data’s life cycle. RDMkit supports FAIR data — Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable — by-design, from the first steps of data management planning to the final steps of depositing data in public archives.

Information is organised by role (e.g., researcher, data steward), scientific domain (e.g., proteomics, human data, bioimaging data), tasks (e.g., data analysis, data management plan, licensing).

### Swedish National Data Service (SND)

## Hands-on data management support

All researchers affiliated with a university or research institute in Sweden working on research topics relevant to pandemic preparedness can receive free individual consultations and hands-on help within reasonable bounds from the *Swedish COVID-19 & Pandemic Preparedness Portal* team. Simply send an email to datacentre@scilifelab.se. Your question will be assigned to a data steward with relevant expertise who can either help you directly or point you to the correct tool or service.

You are welcome to send both general questions about best approaches to research data management, data management plans (DMPs), reproducibility, FAIR, and open science as well as specific questions about your research projects such as which repository to choose to deposit data, what the suitable metadata standards would be, which file formats to use, etc. In some cases the data stewards can act as brokers and submit data to repositories on your behalf.
