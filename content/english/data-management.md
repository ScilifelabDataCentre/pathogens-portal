## Research Data Management

*Research Data management (RDM)* is about how research outputs (e.g. data, code, software etc.) are handled, organized and structured before, during, and after the research project. Good Data Management Practices such as proper planning, management, and documentation of research data will make project management easier and more efficient while projects are being performed and ensure that the research output can be validated and reused by others. Adhering to FAIR principles and Open Science principles are important parts of good RDM practices.

A *Data Management Plan (DMPs)* is a document addressing requirements and practices for the project’s data. The DMP is a living document that will be developed during the research project. In the planning stage, the DMP can outline strategies and be used to estimate resources needed, in the project phase it will be completed with details about data handling, and at the end of the project  links to published datasets and data outputs will be added.  Most national and international funding agencies recognizing the importance of RDM and some now request DMP as part of the grant application process (either to be added at the time of application, or before the granted project receive the grant).

Here we give an overview of available services and support regarding RDM relevant to Swedish researchers working on infectious diseases incl COVID-19), pathogens data, and pandemic preparedness related research.

## Support

### Pathogens Portal Hands-on Data Management support

All researchers affiliated with a university or research institute in Sweden working on research topics relevant to the topics of the Pathogens Portal can receive free individual consultations and hands-on help within reasonable bounds from the Swedish Pathogens Portal team. Simply send an email to <a href="mailto:data-management@scilifelab.se">data-management@scilifelab.se</a> or <a href="mailto:pathogens@scilifelab.se">pathogens@scilifelab.se</a>. Your question are often replied in collaboration with the **SciLifeLab Data Management Helpdesk**.

### SciLifeLab Data Management Helpdesk

Data stewards from NBIS and SciLifeLab Data Centre are available to discuss and provide support regarding data management questions. Email <a href="mailto:data-management@scilifelab.se">data-management@scilifelab.se</a> for contact and support.

## Services

### ENA submission guidelines

### SciLifeLab Data Stewardship Wizard (DSW)

<a target="_blank" href="https://dsw.scilifelab.se/">DSW</a> is a customised tool for creating Data Management Plans (DMPs) with templates conforming to the requirements of the Swedish Research Council and other stakeholders.

### SciLifeLab Research Data Management Guidelines

<a target="_blank" href="https://data-guidelines.scilifelab.se/">SciLifeLab Research Data Management Guidelines</a> is a knowledge hub for the management of life science research data in Sweden. NBIS and SciLifeLab Data Centre have collected a number of  resources related to life science reseach data management in Sweden. The Guidelines are available for each stage of the Research Data Lifecycle.

### SciLifeLab FAIR Storage

<a target="_blank" href="https://data.scilifelab.se/services/fairstorage/">FAIR Storage</a> offers storage resources to support data-driven life science. The service is intended to support data sharing in accordance with the FAIR principles and available for any project that advances knowledge and discovery within the field of Swedish data-driven life science. The allocation of resources and application process are both managed by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.scilifelab.se/data/">SciLifeLab Data Centre</a>. All steering documents related to SciLifeLab FAIR Storage will also be published on this page.

### Infectious Disease Toolkit (IDTk)

The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.infectious-diseases-toolkit.org/">Infectious Diseases Toolkit (IDTk)</a> is a community effort to expose best practices and showcase solutions to data challenges affecting the response to infectious diseases outbreaks. It was created as part of the BY-COVID project. This resource contains information specific for the management of infectious disease data. Information is available specifically about the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.infectious-diseases-toolkit.org/national-resources/sweden">resources related to infectious disease for Sweden</a>.

### ELIXIR Research Data Management Kit (RDMkit)</a>

The <a target="_blank" href="https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/">ELIXIR Research Data Management Kit (RDMkit)</a> is an online guide containing good data management practices applicable to research projects from the beginning to the end. Developed and managed by people who work every day with life science data, the RDMkit has guidelines, information, and pointers to help you with problems throughout the data’s life cycle. RDMkit supports FAIR data — Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable — by-design, from the first steps of data management planning to the final steps of depositing data in public archives.

### Gobal Alliance for Genomics and Health

The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ga4gh.org/">Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH)</a>, formed in 2013 unites an international community dedicated to advancing human health through genomic data. The GA4GH builds technical standards and policy frameworks and tools that will expand responsible, voluntary, and secure use of genomic and other related health data. The work on framework for responsible sharing of genomic and health data.
