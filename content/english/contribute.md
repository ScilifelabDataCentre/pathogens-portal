The _Swedish Pathogens Portal_ was built to serve the community of researchers working on relevant topics and we welcome any contributions from the community or suggestions on how the Portal can help the community. Whenever there is anything that you would like to share with your colleagues, do not hesistate to share it through the Portal. We welcome suggestions for new information or edits in all sections as well as ideas for new sections that could be launched.

For example, you can suggest a dataset that should be covered in the data highlights section or even write one, you can suggest an available dataset that would be useful to others in the community, add information about your own or your colleague's ongoing research project, share data from your project in a new [dashboard](/dashboards/), and so on.

There are multiple ways to add/edit information on the Portal. Choose any method that is most convenient to you, it will reach [the Portal team](/about). We are continuously monitoring communication channels and will approve additions or make changes as soon as we can.
