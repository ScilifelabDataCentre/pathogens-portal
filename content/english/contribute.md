The Swedish COVID-19 & Pandemic Preparedness Data Portal was built to serve the community of researchers working on relevant topics and we welcome any suggestions and contributions from the community. Whenever there is anything that you would like to share with your colleagues, do not hesistate to share it through the Portal. We welcome suggestions for new information or edits in all sections.

For example, you can suggest a dataset that should be covered in the data highlights section or even write one, you can suggest an available dataset that would be useful to others in the community, add information about your or your colleague's ongoing research project, and so on.

There are multiple ways to add/edit information on the Portal. Choose the method that is most convenient to you. The [Portal team](/about) is continuously monitoring communication channels and will approve additions or make changes asap.

All information which is displayed on the Portal is [stored on GitHub](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/covid-portal/tree/develop). The information is stored as .JSON files or as Markdown files, making it human-readable and easy to edit. If you know your way around the web interface of GitHub or GitHub CLI, you can easily edit or add information yourself and send us a pull request.

The information for each section of the Portal is stored in a particular folder and needs to be formatted in a certain way. To make it easier for you to contribute, [we have written detailed instructions for each of the sections](). Please follow these instructions here. If you run into an issue, send us an email so that we can help you.
