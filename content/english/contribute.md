The *Dutch COVID-19 & Pandemic Preparedness Data Portal* was built to serve the community of researchers working on relevant topics and we welcome any contributions from the community or suggestions on how the Portal can help the community. Whenever there is anything that you would like to share with your colleagues, do not hesistate to share it through the Portal. We welcome suggestions for new information or edits in all sections as well as ideas for new sections that could be launched.

For example, you can suggest an available dataset that would be useful to others in the community, add information about ongoing initiatives or share data from your project.

      <p>All information which is displayed on the Portal is <a href="https://github.com/rnavest/covid-nl-portal/tree/develop">stored on GitHub</a>.

If you know your way around the web interface of GitHub or GitHub CLI, you can easily edit or add information yourself and send us a pull request.</p>
      <p>The information for each section of the Portal is stored in a particular folder and needs to be formatted in a certain way.
