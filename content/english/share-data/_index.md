## Share data in a public repository

Publish your COVID-19 & Pandemic Preparedness research data to make it available for the rest of the research community. The data should be deposited in a public repository together with descriptive metadata. [Health-RI](https://www.health-ri.nl/) provides such a public database of COVID related datasets. Feel free to [get in touch](https://www.health-ri.nl/contact) for help on submitting your data.

## Overview of recommended international repositories per data type
The [European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) hosts many different international data repositories which could additionally be used if appropriate. Below are our data submission guidelines for each specific data type. You can also find similar recommendations per data type on [The European COVID-19 Data Portal data submission information](https://www.covid19dataportal.org/submit-data).

* ##### Genomics & transcriptomics data

    We suggest that raw virus sequence data as well as assembled and annotated genomes are submitted to [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena). In order to provide further support to users, ENA provides documentation to help with submission at [SARS-CoV-2 submission](https://ena-browser-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/help_and_guides/sars-cov-2-submissions.html).

    Before submission of raw sequence data (e.g. shotgun sequencing) it is necessary to remove contaminating human reads. Host (human) sequence data requires restricted access, and NBIS is building a local federated version of the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA), allowing for the publication of sensitive personal data within a legal framework.

* ##### Protein data

    For a curated list of relevant proteomics repositories see [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/) using the query ’[proteomics](https://fairsharing.org/search/?q=proteomics&content=biodbcore&name=&taxonomies=&organisations=&shortname=&description=&supportlinks=&licenses=&countries=&maintainers=&expanded_onto_domains=&expanded_onto_disciplines=&user_defined_tags=&record_id=&miriam_id=&search_state=hidden)’.

    We recommend to use the [PRIDE](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/) repository provided by the [ProteomeXchange](http://www.proteomexchange.org/) Consortium. The repository admits protein and peptide identification/quantification data with the accompanying mass spectra evidence and any other related data types. Submission is done using the [PX Submission Tool](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/markdownpage/pridesubmissiontool).

    Metadata: For proteomics, use the minimal information model specified in [MIAPE](https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.8vv5fc), and fill them using the controlled vocabularies specified by the Proteomics Standards Initiative: [PSI CVs](https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.sxh2dp).

* ##### Imaging data

    Depending on the type of image data you have, different public repositories are available, please see the table at [BioImage Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/bioimage-archive/).

    ***

* ##### Biochemistry

    We suggest that users submit data to [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) which is a manually curated database of bioactive molecules with drug-like properties run by EMBL-EBI. It brings together chemical, bioactivity and genomic data to aid the translation of genomic information into effective new drugs.

    ***

* ##### Health data

    We suggest to contact [Health-RI](https://www.health-ri.nl/), who maintain a manually curated database of COVID related datasets.

    ***

* ##### General data repositories

    Most life science data types can be published as raw or processed data in repositories at the [EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk). When no archive is suitable, use a general purpose repository such as [Figshare](https://figshare.com), [DANS](https://dans.knaw.nl/en/) or [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org). Besides scientific data, here you can publish documents, presentations, figures, protocols, or other information that you want to make public at any stage in the research process. A publication here is permanent, and provides a Digital Object Identifier, DOI.
