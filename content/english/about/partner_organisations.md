      <h6>Pathogen Data Network (PDN)</h6>
    </p>The Swedish Pathogens Portal is part of the <a href="https://pathogendatanetwork.org/" target="_blank">Pathogen Data Network</a> (PDN), a major international initiative funded by the <a href="https://www.nih.gov/" target="_blank">National Institutes of Health</a> (NIH) (award number: U24AI183840). The project brings together 12 instutions, and is coordinated by the <a href="https://www.sib.swiss/" target="_blank">SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics</a>. Stakeholders include individuals and organisation from multiple areas, including the biomedical field, hospitals, public health, social sciences, and humanities. </p>
  </p>The PDN project enables a global ecosystem of linked research outputs (e.g. data and tools). It aims to support infectious disease research, and improve responsiveness to outbreaks. The project covers diverse data types, including host and pathogen genomics, transcriptomics, proteins, pathways and networks, and imaging. <a href="https://pathogendatanetwork.org/about/#objectives" target="_blank">PDN’s objectives</a> is four fold: fostering data discovery, supporting efficient surveillance and outbreak response, enabling trustworthy data sharing, and preparing the next generation workforce.</p> 
  
  <p>One of the primary aims of the PDN is to support the development of new Pathogen Portal Nodes (PPNs), i.e. web portal nodes related to infectious disease data that are created by local groups. The <a href="https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/node-pathogens-portal" target="_blank">PPN Toolbox</a> represents minimal code for a PPN. It was developed as part of the PDN project to support the development of new PPNs. Groups aiming to establish a PPN are encouraged to make use of the PPN Toolbox. A list of PPNs can be found on our <a href="https://www.pathogensportal.org/national-data-portals" target="_blank">national nodes page.</a></p>

  <h6>Pathogens Portal</h6>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.pathogensportal.org/" target="_blank">Pathogens Portal</a>, maintained by the European Molecular Biology Laboratory's European Bioinformatics Institute (<a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/" target="_blank">EMBL-EBI</a>) and partners, was launched in July 2023. The Pathogens Portal is a resource for e.g. researchers, clinicians, and policymakers. Its aim is  to facilitate access to the latest and most comprehensive datasets on pathogens. The COVID-19 pandemic put a  spotlight on the importance of data sharing and for focused access to relevant datasets. Therefore, the Pathogens Portal was developed as a centralised platform for  data sharing and accessing data on key pathogens. These pathogens include both pathogens affecting humans and animals, and on vectors and hosts. Bringing together data from a number of sources, and linking data contributes to a better understand Pathogen ́s Biology. Funded through five European Union projects funded under the Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe programmes: <a href="https://recodid.eu/" target="_blank">RECODID</a>, <a href="https://www.veo-europe.eu/" target="_blank">VEO</a>, <a href="https://www.eosc-life.eu/" target="_blank">EOSC-Life</a>, <a href="https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/how-funded/eu-projects/converge" target="_blank">CONVERGE</a> and <a href="https://by-covid.org/" target="_blank">BY-COVID</a>. Moving forward, national nodes of the Pathogens Portal will be added, the Swedish Pathogens Portal is the first to launch in Sept 2023. An overview of other national nodes <a href="/other_national_portals/">can be found here</a>.</p>

      <h6>GA4GH</h6>
    <p>The Swedish COVID-19 & Pandemic Preparedness Data Portal is one of the many partners of the <a href="https://www.ga4gh.org/" target="_blank">Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH)</a> and part of their <a href="https://www.ga4gh.org/what-we-do/communities-of-interest/" target="_blank">Infectious Disease Community</a>.</p>
    <p>GA4GH is an international, non-profit organisation focused on advancing the responsible and effective sharing of genomic and health-related data. GA4GH aims to establish harmonised frameworks and standards in order to promote data interoperability and collaboration in genomics research and healthcare. At the same time, the alliance focuses on fully protecting the human rights of people who share their data. GA4GH brings together experts from various sectors, including academia, industry, and government, to address the ethical, legal, and technical challenges associated with genomic data sharing.</p>
    <p>The Infectious Disease Community, a vital component of the GA4GH, plays a crucial role in bridging the realms of pathogen and host genomics. This community brings together international groups dedicated to standardising the use of genomic data for improved diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases. International groups within the community collaborate to identify opportunities for sharing datasets, workflows, and processes, enabling them to address complex and previously insurmountable questions. Through these collective activities, the Infectious Disease Community facilitates the advancement of genomic research, ultimately leading to improved diagnostic and treatment approaches for infectious diseases.

  <h6>European COVID-19 Data Platform</h6>
    <p>The Swedish Pathogens Portal was originally launched as the ‘Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal’ and it was a national node of the <a href="https://www.covid19dataportal.org/" target="_blank">European COVID-19 Data Platform</a>. The European COVID-19 Data Platform is operated by the <a href="https://ebi.ac.uk" target="_blank">European Bioinformatics Institute</a> (a part of the <a href="https://www.embl.org/" target="_blank">European Molecular Biology Laboratory</a> (EMBL-EBI)), together with the European Commission, and other research partners, such as ELIXIR. An overview of other national nodes <a href="/other_national_portals/">can be found here</a>.</p>
    <p>The European COVID-19 Data Platform aims to facilitate data sharing and analysis in order to accelerate coronavirus research. It enables researchers to upload, access and analyse reference data and specialist datasets related to COVID-19. It is synchronised with COVID-19-related data and scientific literature held in EMBL-EBI's data resources, including ENA, UniProt, PDBe, EMDB, Expression Atlas and Europe PMC. The data continues to grow in diversity and volume, but include sequences, structures, expression data, compound screens, biochemistries and scientific publications.</p>
