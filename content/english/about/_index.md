#### Introduction

The *Dutch COVID-19 & Pandemic Preparedness Data Portal* provides information about available datasets, resources, tools, and services related to pandemic preparedness in the Netherlands. We offer support to all those involved in pandemic preparedness research that are affiliated with a Dutch research institution or university.

The Portal is operated by [Lygature](https://www.lygature.org/) and [partners](organisations_and_programs). This website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) in combination with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling, [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) for tables, and [Vega/Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) for interactive graphics. All code used for the Portal is open source (held under an [MIT licence](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)) and [is available on GitHub](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/covid-portal). We encourage the reuse of our code, either for generating another national portal, or recreating certain features.

#### History of the Portal

The Dutch COVID-19 & Pandemic Preparedness Portal was launched in April 2023 as part of the [BY-COVID](https://by-covid.org/) project funced by the European Commission (more details [here](https://www.embl.org/news/science/embl-ebi-launches-covid-19-data-portal/)). The Portal is a national node of the [European COVID-19 Data Platform](https://covid19dataportal.eu/). An overview of other national nodes can be found [here](/partners/).

From the start, the Portal has been operated by the SciLifeLab Data Centre and partners. However, it has received considerable input from the community. Indeed, many people contributed to building the initial site, and content throughout. An overview of some of the contributors that have been instrumental to establishing and advancing the Portal can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/covid-portal/graphs/contributors).

#### Portal team

Many people from SciLifeLab, NBIS, other organisations, and the community have been involved in the Portal since its conception. A complete list of contributors can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/covid-portal/graphs/contributors). Below, we show the current team of people actively working on the Portal.

The team are happy to help with using the Portal, to take suggestions regarding new and existing sections, and to answer any questions that you may have. Please just get in touch using for [contact](/contact/) form.
