The Swedish Pathogens Portal originated as the 'Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal'. It was the first national node of the [European COVID-19 Data Platform](https://covid19dataportal.org/); a Europe-wide platform allowing researchers to upload, access, and analyse COVID-19 related datasets. The [European COVID-19 Data Platform](https://covid19dataportal.org/) was launched in the spring of 2020 when the European Commission [took the initiative to develop a European data sharing platform for COVID-19 research efforts](https://www.embl.org/news/science/embl-ebi-launches-covid-19-data-portal/). It is operated by the European Molecular Biology Laboratory - European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) and [partners](https://www.covid19dataportal.org/partners).

Besides [Sweden](https://www.pathogens.se), a number of other countries also launched national portals, many of which used [our source code](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/covid-portal) to get started! Below is a list of the other national COVID-19 data portals:

- [COVID-19 Data Portal Estonia](https://covid19dataportal.ee)
- [COVID-19 Data Portal Greece](https://www.covid19dataportal.gr)
- [COVID-19 Data Portal Italy](https://www.covid19dataportal.it)
- [COVID-19 Data Portal Japan](https://covid19dataportal.jp)
- [COVID-19 Data Portal Luxembourg](https://covid19dataportal.lu)
- [COVID-19 Data Portal Netherlands](https://www.covid19dataportal.nl)
- [COVID-19 Data Portal Poland](https://covid19dataportal.pl)
- [COVID-19 Data Portal Slovenia](https://covid19dataportal.si)
- [COVID-19 Data Portal Spain](https://www.covid19dataportal.es)

Norway and Turkey ([see Turkey's archived portal](https://www.loc.gov/item/lcwaN0030712/)) also had national COVID-19 data portals throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.

In July 2023, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory's European Bioinformatics Institute ([EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/)) launched a new version of the [Pathogens Portal](https://www.pathogensportal.org/). This reflects global move towards general pandemic preparedness, and away from just COVID-19 specifically. The Pathogens Portal holds data and information about multiple pathogens and pandemic preparedness in general.

In August 2023, we transitioned the Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal into the first national node of the Pathogens Portal ([read our news](https://www.pathogens.se/updates/pathogens_portal/)). It is now known as the Swedish Pathogens Portal. In time, other national nodes of will come online, and will be listed below.
