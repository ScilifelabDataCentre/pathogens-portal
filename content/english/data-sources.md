Title: Data sources & repositories
---

This page includes displays **Data Sources** and **Repositories** relevant to the scope of the Swedish Pathogens Portal (i.e. infectious disease and pandemic preparedness in Sweden). **Data sources** are defined as resources where at least some users can access (but not submit) data. **Repositories**, by contrast, are resources in which at least some users can both access and submit data.

Use the **Search** function to locate data sources/repositries by name/keywords (often more granular than other filters). It is also possible to filter data sources according to **Data Type**.

[Get in touch](/contact/) about adding further data sources.
