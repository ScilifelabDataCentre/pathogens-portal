Title: Data sources
---

This is a list of data sources available for *Epidemiology and biology of infection* in Sweden. Use the **Search** function to find sources by name/keywords (often more granular than other filters). A resource type of **Repository** indicates that at least some users can both submit and access data, whilst **Data Source** indicates that data can only be accessed, not submitted. It is also possible to filter data sources according to **Data Type**.

[Get in touch](/contact/) about adding further data sources.
