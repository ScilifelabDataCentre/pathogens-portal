The [Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal](https://covid19dataportal.se/) invites researchers and general public to take part in the **COVID-19 Data & Code Reuse Competition**. Participants should complete small-scale projects that make use of publicly shared data and/or code to combat the COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemics.

Three winning projects will be awarded support from the [SciLifeLab Data Centre](https://scilifelab.se/data) to promote the project and/or to enable follow-up work. The exact type of support provided will be tailored to the needs of each project. Support could comprise of, for example, free hosting for one year, free storage for one year, a feature on the COVID-19 Data portal (e.g. as a data highlight or a page with visualisations), and/or visibility through press and social media of SciLifeLab and SciLifeLab Data Centre.

We welcome various types of project. Projects could, for example, involve the reanalysis of existing publicly available data using a method different from that used originally or to answer a different question than in the original research. Alternatively, projects might reuse publicly shared code to process  a new set of data. Other possibilities include projects that produce individual visualisations, dashboards presenting publicly shared data in a novel way or web-services devoted to data and analyses. The emphasis of the projects submitted should be to maximise the utility of existing data and/or code.

#### Who can submit an entry?

- The competition is **open to everyone**; both from academia (students, PhD candidates, postdocs, researchers, etc.) and the wider community.
- Competition entries can be submitted either by **individuals or groups**. Collaborative projects are welcome.

#### How does the competition work?

- Participants are invited to enter small-scale research projects that contribute to the understanding of SARS-CoV-2, the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic or combatting future pandemics. The submitted projects should have a clear goal and outcome. Participants are welcome to spend as much or as little time on their competition entry as they wish.
- Each competition entry must reuse data and/or code that has been made available in a public repository or assigned a DOI. We encourage the participants to search for data or code through the [Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal](https://covid19dataportal.se/), the [European COVID-19 Data Portal](https://covid19dataportal.org), and other [national COVID-19 Data Portals](https://covid19dataportal.se/partners/). Be sure to adhere to the license conditions under which the original data or code were published.
- Participants are welcome to reuse their own data or code for new projects, as long they have been made publicly available before the competition entry is submitted.
- Participants retain all rights to their project and are welcome to use the project outcome in any way they wish, including as part of further work or in publications.

#### How to submit an entry?

- To enter a project into the competition, submit your project outcome (e.g. a PDF, a poster, a presentation, a dashboard, or a link) as an entry to the [SciLifeLab Data Repository](https://scilifelab.figshare.com/). You can log in with your Swedish university user ID or, if you are not affiliated with a Swedish university, you can get in touch with the SciLifeLab Data Centre at [datacentre@scilifelab.se](mailto:datacentre@scilifelab.se) to obtain an account.
- Any newly generated data, code and other materials should be made publicly available as part of the SciLifeLab Data Repository item submitted as an entry.
- Follow the SciLifeLab Data Repository [submission guidelines](https://www.scilifelab.se/data/repository/submission/) to add your entry.
- Provide information about and a link to, the source of the original data or code reused in the project in the "Description" field of your entry.
- Add the keyword “COVID-19 Data & Code Reuse Competition” in the “Keywords” field of your entry.
- Competition entries will go through the standard review process of the SciLifeLab Data Repository. Please note that the review process can take about one week. Your submission must be approved and published by the deadline.
- Competition entries will be accepted between the 15th of May and the 15th of September 2021.

#### Evaluation criteria

- The submitted projects will be evaluated on the following criteria:
    - Fulfillment of entry criteria.
    - Demonstrated value of data and/or code reuse in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic or future pandemics.
    - Clear scientific documentation and communication of the results.
- The winning entries will be selected by a jury led by the [COVID-19 Data Portal team members](/about/).
