## About this tutorial

The research community has put remarkable effort into the study of both the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19, the disease that it causes. Thanks to this global effort, many SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences are now available in international databases such as GISAID and the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA). Both of these databases constitute valuable resources, each with their own relative advantages for those performing research. As of October 2021, GISAID contains considerably more data from around the world, thus enabling more reliable insights into the situation globally. However, GISAID does not include 'raw' sequence data, and access to its data is restricted to those with verified accounts. ENA, on the other hand, allows for the submission of 'raw' sequences and access to the data is unrestricted.

This tutorial aims to assist researchers in submitting SARS-CoV-2 sequence data to ENA. We hope that this will ultimately lead to an increased availability of open data, including ‘raw’ sequence data. This would not only facilitate greater reproducibility, but also provide more opportunity for reusing the data to address new scientific questions.

In this tutorial, we describe (a) how sample data related to SARS-CoV-2 sequences should be formatted for submission, and (b) the steps for submitting sequences and associated data to ENA.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of this tutorial you will:

* Understand the terminology used by ENA (and other similar databases).

* Know how to properly describe and format SARS-CoV-2 (meta)data for submission into ENA.

* Know how to complete a submission into ENA.

* Know where to get help for future submissions (whether for SARS-CoV-2, or something else) to ENA.

## Prerequisites

No specific knowledge is needed before starting this tutorial.

## Overview

This tutorial is separated into tabs to aid users in moving through the tutorial. If you are unfamiliar with ENA, we recommend reading the [Terminology and Metadata tab](/support_services/tutorial_ena/tutorial_ena_terminology) before commencing with the tutorial.

Multiple routes of submission are possible with ENA. We decsribe two complete routes that can be used for submission. Some preparation is necessary for submission using either route, and we describe these steps in the [Preparations for Submissions tab](/support_services/tutorial_ena/tutorial_ena_subprep). We explain how to determine which of the routes is most likely to work best for you in the [Select Submission Route tab](/support_services/tutorial_ena/tutorial_ena_selectsub). The [Submission Route 1](/support_services/tutorial_ena/tutorial_ena_subroute1) and [Submission Route 2](/support_services/tutorial_ena/tutorial_ena_subroute2) tabs explain different routes to completing submissions to ENA.

Information about where to get further guidance is given in the [Get Help tab](/support_services/tutorial_ena/tutorial_ena_contact).
