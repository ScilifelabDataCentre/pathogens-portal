## General data repositories

Most life science data types can be published as raw or processed data in repositories at the [EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk) as described under [Data types](https://covid19dataportal.se/data_types/). When no archive is suitable, use a general purpose repository such as [Figshare](https://figshare.com) or [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org). This includes documents, presentations, figures, protocols, or other information that you want to make public at any stage in the research process. A publication here is permanent, and provides a Digital Object Identifier, DOI.

SciLifeLab supports COVID-19 related data to be published in the [SciLifeLab Data Repository](https://scilifelab.figshare.com).

If you have datasets related to COVID-19 research that are best suited for this type of repository, please contact the SciLifeLab Data Centre at [datacentre@scilifelab.se](mailto:datacentre@scilifelab.se) or visit our [repository support page](https://www.scilifelab.se/data/repository).
