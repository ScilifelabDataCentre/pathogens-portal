![NBIS Logo](/img/logos/nbislogo-orange-txt.svg#floatright)
The SciLifeLab Bioinformatics platform [NBIS](https://nbis.se/) offers a wide range of skills to help with your COVID-19 related research project.
We have ~90 expert staff that can support you with bioinformatics analysis, systems development, and data management.
In all our projects we are committed to FAIR and reproducible research that meets the highest scientific standards.

Currently, we are prioritising research projects related to COVID-19.
[Get in touch for a free consultation](https://nbis.se/support/) and find out how we can help your project become a success.

## Bioinformatics

We are experienced bioinformaticians with multiple areas of expertise in, but not limited to, a wide variety of applications such as genetic variation, expression analysis, single cell, genome assembly & annotation, phylogenomics, proteomics, metabolomics, machine learning, big data, integrative analysis, and biostatistics.

## Systems development

The Systems developers team can help with anything from scaling and optimising your tools and code to setting up portals, resources and databases.

## Data Management

To make datasets available in the European COVID-19 data portals (see [Submit data](../submit)), NBIS can assist you with Data Management Planning, FAIRification of data, and data publishing to public repositories according to the internationally agreed standards.

To make your research and data sharing more efficient it is recommended, and sometimes required by funders, to create a Data Management Plan early on in your project. A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a revisable document stating how you intend to handle new and existing data, both during and following the conclusion of your research project.
We provide a [customised tool](https://dsw.scilifelab.se/) for creating DMPs with templates conforming to the requirements of the Swedish Research Council and other stakeholders.
