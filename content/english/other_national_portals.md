### National Pathogens Portals

In July 2023, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory's European Bioinformatics Institute ([EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/)) launched a new version of the [Pathogens Portal](https://www.pathogensportal.org/). This reflected a global move towards general pandemic preparedness, and away from COVID-19 specifically. The Pathogens Portal holds data and information about multiple pathogens and pandemic preparedness in general.

In August 2023, the Swedish Pathogens Portal was launched, becoming the first national pathogens portal node ([see our news on the launch](https://www.pathogens.se/updates/pathogens_portal/)). The Swedish Pathogens Portal was soon used as a basis for other national pathogens portals.

The [Pathogens Data Network (PDN)](https://pathogendatanetwork.org) was formed in 2024. One of its aims was to create a knowledge base enabling access to pathogens data. Work on the knowledge base was co-led by SciLifeLab Data Centre and EMBL-EBI. As part of this work, SciLifeLab Data Centre created [openly available code for a minimal local/national pathogens portal](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/node-pathogens-portal), based on the Swedish Pathogens Portal, which they developed, to facilitate the launch of other pathogens portals.

### National COVID-19 Data Portals

The Swedish Pathogens Portal was originally launched as the 'Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal'. It was the first national node of the [European COVID-19 Data Platform](https://covid19dataportal.org/); a Europe-wide platform allowing researchers to upload, access, and analyse COVID-19 related datasets. The [European COVID-19 Data Platform](https://covid19dataportal.org/) was launched in the spring of 2020 when the European Commission [took the initiative to develop a European data sharing platform for COVID-19 research efforts](https://www.embl.org/news/science/embl-ebi-launches-covid-19-data-portal/). It is operated by the European Molecular Biology Laboratory - European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) and [partners](https://www.covid19dataportal.org/partners).

Multiple other countries used the Swedish portal as a basis for their own national node, with some using the source code directly as a basis.

Norway and Turkey ([see Turkey's archived portal](https://www.loc.gov/item/lcwaN0030712/)) also had national COVID-19 data portals throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.
