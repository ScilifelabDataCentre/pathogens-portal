The *Dutch COVID-19 & Pandemic Preparedness Data Portal* is a hub for data, tools, services, and other resources centred around COVID-19 and pandemic preparedness in the Netherlands.

The Portal is involved in multiple projects, platforms, and initiatives. It is the Dutch node of the [European COVID-19 Data Platform](https://www.covid19dataportal.org), and is involved in the [Horizon BY-COVID project](https://by-covid.org).

The Portal is operated by [Lygature](https://www.lygature.org/) and partners. To learn more about us, including meeting the team behind the Portal, see our [about page](/about/). We welcome contributions from the community, and have established an [editorial committee](/about/editorial_committee/) to increase engagement with the research community. There are multiple ways to [contribute](/contribute/), so please get in touch!
