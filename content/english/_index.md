The *Swedish Pathogens Portal* is a hub for data, tools, services, and other resources centred around COVID-19 and pandemic preparedness in Sweden.

The Portal is involved in multiple projects, platforms, and initiatives. It is the Swedish node of the [European COVID-19 Data Platform](https://www.covid19dataportal.org). It is a pillar of the [SciLifeLab Pandemic Laboratory Preparedness (PLP) Program](https://www.scilifelab.se/capabilities/pandemic-laboratory-preparedness/), and is involved in the [Horizon BY-COVID project](https://by-covid.org).

The Portal is operated by the [SciLifeLab Data Centre](https://scilifelab.se/data/) and partners. To learn more about us, including meeting the team behind the Portal, see our [about page](/about/). We welcome contributions from the community, and have established an [editorial committee](/about/editorial_committee/) to increase engagement with the research community. There are multiple ways to [contribute](/contribute/), so please get in touch!
