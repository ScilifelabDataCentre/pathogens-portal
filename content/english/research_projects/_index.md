This is a manually curated overview of research projects on COVID-19, infectious diseases in general, and antibiotic resistance which are funded by major funding agencies in Sweden. New projects are added on an ongoing basis. If you would like your project to be listed here, [please get in touch with us](/suggestions/).

See also [SweCRIS](https://www.swecris.se/betasearch/?q=Covid&view=cards&lang=en), a database of all funded research projects for many of the large funding agencies in Sweden, where it is possible to search using custom keywords. For those interested specifically in COVID-19 projects, there is list of all ethically approved clinical studies on COVID-19 in Sweden [available on Kliniskastudier.se](https://www.kliniskastudier.se/statistik/kliniska-studier-rorande-covid-19.html) (updated regularly; page available only in Swedish).
