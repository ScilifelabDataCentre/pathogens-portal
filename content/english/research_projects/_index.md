This is a manually curated overview of research projects on COVID-19 which are funded by major funding agencies in Sweden. New projects are added on an ongoing basis. If you would like your project to be listed here, [please get in touch with us](/suggestions/). See also [SweCRIS](https://www.swecris.se/betasearch/?q=Covid&view=cards&lang=en), a database of all funded research projects in Sweden, where it is possible to search using custom keywords.

A list of all ethically approved clinical studies on COVID-19 in Sweden [is available on Kliniskastudier.se](https://www.kliniskastudier.se/statistik/kliniska-studier-rorande-covid-19.html) (updated regularly; page available only in Swedish).
