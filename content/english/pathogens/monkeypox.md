## General information

Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease, i.e. one that is transmitted from animals to humans. It is caused by the monkeypox virus. The virus is a member of the *Orthopoxvirus* genus in the family *Poxviridae*. It is closely related to the *variola virus* (smallpox) that has had a major effect on human populations throughout history.

The monkeypox virus is endemic in certain areas of west and central Africa, but not elsewhere, and outbreaks in other regions are rare. However, in May 2022, multiple cases were detected in different European countries, including Sweden. This lead to fears that the virus could become more wide-spread ([WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/health-topics/monkeypox#tab=tab_1); [Adler et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(22)00228-6)).

Clinically, monkeypox is typically characterised by fever, unexplained acute rash, and lymphadenopathy. Additional symptoms and complications may also occur, though. Limited information is available regarding mortality rate, but the rates reported vary significantly (from 1 - 10%) ([Adler et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(22)00228-6)). There are no currently licenced treatments for human monkeypox, although brincidofovir and tecovirimat (both drigs approved in the USA for used against smallpox) show promise in animal studies ([Adler et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(22)00228-6)).

There are currently two clades of monkeypox virus: the West African clade and the Congo Basin (Central African) clade [according to the WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2022-DON385).

## Ongoing research and data efforts

In this section, we present announcements about ongoing research efforts primarily by (but not limited to) researchers and organisations in Sweden. The intention is to 'highlight' these efforts as soon as possible, so that we can maximise their usefulness to researchers.

Please feel free to submit an announcement by using the form below or by sending us an e-mail to datacentre@scilifelab.se.

Lists of data, tools, publications, and other potentially useful information are provided further down on the page and likely to be more complete.

## Tools available

These tools have been adapted/developed for use with the monkeypox virus. They could potentially be adapted for use with other viruses, and with other types of infectious disease. They are thus key in aiding future pandemic preparedness.

- Code used to produce NextStrain builds is avaiable on [GitHub](https://github.com/nextstrain/monkeypox).
- NextStrain builds: [build using hmpxv1 dataset](https://nextstrain.org/monkeypox/hmpxv1) (focused on human-to-human transmission), [build using hmpxv1 dataset](https://nextstrain.org/monkeypox/mpxv) (includes samples from the animal reservoir and previous human outbreaks).
- [Galaxy workflows](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/mpxv/) for analysis of monkeypox virus sequence data.
- Summary of tools that have been repurposed to enable monkeypox [viral sequence submission & guidance on how to use them](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/enasequence/ena-content-dataflow/raw/master/docs/Monkeypox%20virus%20ENA%20Submission%20Guidance.pdf).
