## General information

Monkeypox is a zoonosis, a disease that is transmitted from animals to humans. It is caused by monkeypox virus. The virus is a member of the *Orthopoxvirus* genus in the family *Poxviridae* and it is closely related to the *variola virus* (smallpox) that historically affected large portions of people on the European continent and worldwide. The virus is known to be endemic is certain areas of west and central Africa, but outbreaks outside of these regions are rare. However, in May 2022 separate cases has been detected seen in several European countries, incl. Sweden. This has raised the fear for a spread of a more wide-spread monkeypox outbreak ([WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/health-topics/monkeypox#tab=tab_1); [Adler et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(22)00228-6))

Clinically monkeypox is characterized by fever, unexplained acute rash, and lymphadenopathy. However additional complications may occur. There are limited published mortality rates, and the rates vary substantially ranging from 1% to 10% ([Adler et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(22)00228-6)). While there are few available treatments,  brincidofovir and tecovirimat, are drugs originally approved for treatment of smallpox, with demonstrated efficacy in animal studies ([Adler et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(22)00228-6)).

There are two clades of monkeypox virus: the West African clade and the Congo Basin (Central African) clade [according to the WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2022-DON385).
