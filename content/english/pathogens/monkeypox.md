## General information

Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease, i.e. one that is transmitted from animals to humans. It is caused by the monkeypox virus. The virus is a member of the *Orthopoxvirus* genus in the family *Poxviridae*. It is closely related to the *variola virus* (smallpox) that has had a major effect on human populations throughout history.

The monkeypox virus is endemic in certain areas of west and central Africa, but not elsewhere, and outbreaks in other regions are rare. However, in May 2022, multiple cases were detected in different European countries, including Sweden. This lead to fears that the virus could become more wide-spread ([WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/health-topics/monkeypox#tab=tab_1); [Adler et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(22)00228-6)). Since the start of the outbreak in May, over 20,000 cases have been detected in Europe, to-date (2022-09-01) 161 cases have been found in Sweden and reported to the Swedish Public Health Agency.

Clinically, monkeypox is typically characterised by fever, unexplained acute rash, and lymphadenopathy. Additional symptoms and complications may also occur (for more information see [here](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/symptoms/index.html)). The incubation time is normally 5-13 days but may be up to three weeks. At this time close personal contact with an infected individual is the most common way of transmission.

Limited information is available regarding mortality rate, but the rates reported vary significantly (from 1 - 10%) ([Adler et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(22)00228-6)). There are no currently licenced treatments for human monkeypox, although brincidofovir and tecovirimat (both drigs approved in the USA for used against smallpox) show promise in animal studies ([Adler et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(22)00228-6)). While no vaccine is approved in Europe by EMA yet, EU healthcare has access to doses of Jynneosvaccine, which is approved by the FDA for both monkey pox and small pox, donated by the USA and Canada (read more about the vaccine [here](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/vaccines/jynneos.html)) via the European Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA).

There are currently two clades of monkeypox virus: the West African clade and the Congo Basin (Central African) clade [according to the WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2022-DON385).

## Ongoing research and data efforts

In this section, we present announcements about ongoing research efforts primarily by (but not limited to) researchers and organisations in Sweden. The intention is to 'highlight' these efforts as soon as possible, so that we can maximise their usefulness to researchers.

Please feel free to submit an announcement by using the form below or by sending us an e-mail to datacentre@scilifelab.se.

Lists of data, tools, publications, and other potentially useful information are provided further down on the page and likely to be more complete.

## Tools available

These tools have been adapted/developed for use with the monkeypox virus. They could potentially be adapted for use with other viruses, and with other types of infectious disease. They are thus key in aiding future pandemic preparedness.

- Code used to produce NextStrain builds is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nextstrain/monkeypox)
- NextStrain builds: [build using hmpxv1 dataset](https://nextstrain.org/monkeypox/hmpxv1) (focused on human-to-human transmission), [build using hmpxv1 dataset](https://nextstrain.org/monkeypox/mpxv) (includes samples from the animal reservoir and previous human outbreaks)
