Our **Emerging pathogens** section is dedicated to bringing you the latest information on new and emerging pathogens. Each page will be dedicated to the data/tools/publications available for a given pathogen. You are also able to submit announcements, which you can use to alert others of useful resources. Please note that, due to the necessarily fast-paced nature of work related to emerging pathogens, that much of the work detailed on these pages may not have been subject to *peer review*. Further, pages may be subject to frequent change as more information becomes available.
