## Background

[Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/smittskydd-beredskap/smittsamma-sjukdomar/rs-virusinfektion/) is a common virus. It causes cold-like symptoms, ranging from blocked/runny nose, cough, sneezing, tiredness, and fever in adults. Symptoms in infants can also include irritability and reduced appetite. The majority of cases resolve without treatment, but infants and older adults can develop serious symptoms that require intervention.

RSV spreads through droplets released when infected individuals cough or sneeze. The risk of infection can be reduced by cleaning surfaces and toys regularly, distancing from infected individuals, and hand washing. The [RSV vaccine](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/smittskydd-beredskap/vaccinationer/vacciner-som-anvands-i-sverige/vaccin-mot-rs-virus/) is recommended for pregnant women to protect newborns, and older adults. The vaccination reduces the risk of pneumonia and bronchiolitis.

RSV outbreaks can occur at any time, but are most common during the colder months, typically lasting around five months. The exact timing can differ between regions, but in Sweden, Folkhälsomyndigheten (The Public Health Agency of Sweden) publishes a weekly overview of reported [RSV cases](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/folkhalsorapportering-statistik/statistik-a-o/sjukdomsstatistik/rsv-veckorapporter/aktuell-veckorapport-om-rsv/) by county between October and May. [These reports (available only in Swedish)](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/folkhalsorapportering-statistik/statistik-a-o/sjukdomsstatistik/rsv/), enable the spread of RSV to be tracked across Sweden. The data is gathered from voluntary reports by laboratories and pediatric clinics.
