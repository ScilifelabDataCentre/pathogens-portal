## Background

Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease, i.e. one that is transmitted from animals to humans. It is caused by the monkeypox virus. The virus is a member of the *Orthopoxvirus* genus in the family *Poxviridae*. It is closely related to the *variola virus* (smallpox) that has had a major effect on human populations throughout history.

The monkeypox virus is endemic in certain areas of west and central Africa, but not elsewhere, and outbreaks in other regions are rare. However, in May 2022, multiple cases were detected in different European countries, including Sweden. This lead to fears that the virus could become more wide-spread ([WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/health-topics/monkeypox#tab=tab_1); [Adler et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(22)00228-6)).

Clinically, monkeypox is typically characterised by fever, unexplained acute rash, and lymphadenopathy. Additional symptoms and complications may also occur, though. Limited information is available regarding mortality rate, but the rates reported vary significantly (from 1 - 10%) ([Adler et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(22)00228-6)). There are no currently licenced treatments for human monkeypox, although brincidofovir and tecovirimat (both drigs approved in the USA for used against smallpox) show promise in animal studies ([Adler et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(22)00228-6)).

There are currently two clades of monkeypox virus: the West African clade and the Congo Basin (Central African) clade [according to the WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2022-DON385).
