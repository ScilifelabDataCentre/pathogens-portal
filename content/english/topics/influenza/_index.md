## Background

Influenza, caused by one of the four virus types A, B, C and D, is a common respiratory infection. While influenza strains A and B cause typical flu symptoms, C is milder, and D has so far not been detected in humans. Influenza, or “flu”  as its often referred to, returns regularly in the winter season and affects a large part of the population. Influenza can have severe effects and even lead to excess in mortality among the elderly and frail patients.

The influenza virus can spread by aerosols, droplets, or direct contact. Elderly, and risk groups are recommended yearly influenza vaccination as previous infection may not give protection against a new infection.  The influenza viruses, primarily found in the throat and airways, have the ability to change and may therefore cause more extensive outbreak or pandemics. The most known influenza pandemics, Spanish Flu after WWI, had large effect on society and health of people worldwide. Given the potential negative effects of influenza on public health, continuous efforts are made to monitor its spread and to develop vaccines against novel strains.
