## Resource or database connected to Influenza

### WHO Global Influenza Programme

<https://www.who.int/teams/global-influenza-programme>

The Global Influenza Program (GIP) from the World Health Organisation (WHO) is providing its member states with strategic guidance eg. surveillance, monitoring and technical support. The GIP program collects and analyzes virological and epidemiological data from the member states which will allow WHO to monitor trends in influenza.  WHO also supports selection of influenza strains for seasonal vaccines. The GIP is also working to support the members states with pandemic preparedness efforts such as seasonal, zoonotic, and pandemic influenza threats.

### FluNet

<https://www.who.int/tools/flunet>

The FluNet, a web-based tool, used for influenza surveillance, is an important part of the WHO influenza efforts. It is an open tool where the users may access weekly updated information about  global or regional influenza activity, download data reports, and explore influenza trends in table, maps or graphs. The surveillance data in FluNet is provided from the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS)

**Keywords:** influenza, surveillance, WHO, global, data<br>
**Organisation:** World Health Organization<hr>

### FluView

<https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm>

The FluView, a surveillance system from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), tracks influenza in the US. The system provides weekly updates about the virus, cases, tested, flu cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. See the interactive dashboards [here](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html) The system offers both national and state-level reports, as well as coverage and flu forecasting tools.

### Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID)

<https://www.gisaid.org/>

GISAID is an international data sharing platform. GISAID started only sharing genomic data for influenza. Today it also holds a large number of SARS-CoV-2 and MPox sequences. GISAID includes sequences, as well as associated metadata eg. date and location of isolation. In order to use the data, the platform requires registration before download.

### The Flu Tracking Project

<https://info.flutracking.net/>

The Flu Tracking Project is a citizen science online health surveillance system  monitoring Australia and New Zeeland. The project monitors influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Participants can sign up for weekly surveys to report symptoms of ILI. The data collected in the project is then used to generate weekly influenza reports for Australia.

### Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

<https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm>

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are tracking influenza in the US and doing weekly updates. CDC also track the impact of a number of other respiratory viruses eg. SARS-CoV-2 Data comparing the impact of these viruses can be found in two new dashboards: [RESP-NET](https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/resp-net/dashboard.html) and NSSP’s Emergency Department Visits for [COVID-19, Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus](https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/surveillance/respiratory-illnesses/index.html).

### RESP-NET

<https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/resp-net/dashboard.html>

The Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RESP-NET)  contains population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed hospitalizations associated with  a number of respiratory viruses eg. COVID-19, Influenza, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) among children and adults. It comprises three platforms. The platforms COVID-NET, FluSurv-NET, and RSV-NET, respectively). Surveillance through a network of acute care hospitals in select counties in 13 states.

**Keywords:** influenza, COVID-19, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) population-based surveillance.<br>
