As part of the [Pathogen Data Network (PDN)](https://pathogendatanetwork.org), funded by the [National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/) (award number U24AI183840), and coordinated by the [SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics](https://www.sib.swiss/), SciLifeLab Data Centre has created a [Pathogens Portal Node (PPN) Toolbox](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/node-pathogens-portal).

The [PPN Toolbox](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/node-pathogens-portal) contains the minimum code needed to produce a PPN (e.g. the Swedish Pathogens Portal). This minimal code is intended to facilitate the development of other PPNs, and is being used to create multiple upcoming PPNs. See [PDN news on upcoming portals](https://pathogendatanetwork.org/announcing-the-first-community-led-pathogens-portal-nodes/), and see our [Pathogen Portal Nodes page](/other_national_portals) to keep up to date on new PPNs.

SciLifeLab Data Centre has been working with the PDNâ€™s Community of Practice to develop a roadmap describing work to be conducted on the PPN Toolbox in the second year of the project. This [roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K1vG6zdTM69xpNGdTC3FObPZ2WehXYc6y3F4j1-cfeQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.tza3nqjp30d8) is now publicly available to view on the [PPN Toolbox GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/node-pathogens-portal#roadmap).
