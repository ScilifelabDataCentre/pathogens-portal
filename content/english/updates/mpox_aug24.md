Mpox is a zoonotic disease caused by the mpox virus. It has 2 clades (clades 1 and 2), each with two subclades. Clade 1 is the most contagious, and has a higher mortality rate. It is usually transmitted from animals to humans, although it can be transmitted between humans upon close contact. More general information about mpox is available on our [mpox topic](/topics/mpox/) and [mpox emerging pathogens](/pathogens/mpox/) pages, and from [Folkhälsomyndigheten](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/the-public-health-agency-of-sweden/communicable-disease-control/disease-information-about-mpox/).

In August 2024, the first case of clade 1 variant mpox was diagnosed outside of African continent. The case was detected in Sweden, although the individual was infected in Africa during clade 1 mpox outbreak. Sweden is fully prepared to diagnose, isolate people diagnosed with mpox. The threat to the general population is currently designated as low, with only occasional, imported cases, like that detected in Sweden, expected. More information about this particular case is available from [Folkhälsomyndigheten](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/the-public-health-agency-of-sweden/communicable-disease-control/disease-information-about-mpox/one-case-of-mpox-clade-i-reported-in-sweden/).

The Swedish Pathogens Portal continues to monitor and investigate research resources linked to emergent diseases, like mpox. Information on such diseases, including on related data and other research resources, is added to our [emerging pathogens section](/pathogens/). Where possible, the portal will also create data dashboards, and other resources, to display data and accelerate research in the area.
