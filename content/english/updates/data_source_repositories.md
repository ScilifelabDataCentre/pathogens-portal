The primary aim of the Swedish Pathogens Portal is to make research resources within it's scope (e.g. serology data for a given pathogen) as Open and FAIR as possible. An important part of achieving this aim is ensuring that resources are findable. For a resource to be findable, it must be shared somewhere that is easily located by those aiming to use/reuse the resource.

In order to maximise the findability of data within the Portal's scope, we have added a page on [data sources & repositories](/data-sources/). Here, users can find places that host/link to data relevant to their needs (**data sources**), as well as places to share relevant data (**data repositories**). In order to quickly find the most relevant data sources/repositories, users are able to **filter by specific types of data** (e.g. clinical data, genetic data, proteomic data) or **type of resource** (i.e. whether it is a data source or repository), and use terms to **search** the list.

The content of this page will be continuously updated. If you are aware of relevant data sources/repositories that are not listed, please [get in touch](/contact/) to let us know!
