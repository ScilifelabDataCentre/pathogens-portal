We have been working with the Norder group at Gothenburg University to update the [wastewater dashboard](/dashboards/wastewater/).

The group have been working to test a new method for the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 and enteric viruses in wastewater. The group have been examining the levels of viruses in Gothenburg's wastewater for many years, including before the pandemic. In 2023, they began to collaborate directly with the portal in order to be able to share their data in near-real time.

The data and information related to their latest method have been placed on their existing pages for the quantification of [SARS-CoV-2](/dashboards/wastewater/covid_quantification/covid_quant_gu/) and [enteric viruses](/dashboards/wastewater/enteric_quantification/) in wastewater in Gothenburg. The data and information related to their previous method have been moved to historic/archived pages ([historic data for SARS-CoV-2](/dashboards/wastewater/covid_quantification/historic_covid_gu/) and [enteric viruses](/dashboards/wastewater/enteric_quantification/historic_enteric_gu/)), to ensure that this valuable information remains available for future pandemic preparedness. All of these pages are available in both Swedish and English.

We will continue to work with research groups to support data sharing, and therefore accelerate pandemic preparedness research. If you have a request for a given type of content, or would like a dashboard/highlight/other content for your own data, please [get in touch](/contact/) with the portal team to discuss it.
