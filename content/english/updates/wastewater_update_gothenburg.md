We have been working with the Norder group at Uppsala university to update the [wastewater dashboard](/dashboards/wastewater/).

Over the last year, the group have worked to update the methods that they use to quantify the levels of SARS-CoV-2 and enteric viruses. The group have been providing testing the wastewater in Gothenburg for many years, including before the pandemic. Since 2023, they have collaborated directly with the Portal to share their data with the community in almost real time.

The data and information related to the new methods have been placed on their existing pages for the quantification for [SARS-CoV-2]() and [enteric viruses]() in wastewater in Gothenburg. The data and information related to their previous methods has been moved to historic/archived pages ([historic data for SARS-CoV-2]() and [enteric viruses]()), to ensure that this valuable information remains available for future pandemic preparedness. All pages are available in both Swedish and English.

We will continue to work with research groups to support data sharing, and therefore accelerate pandemic preparedness research. If you have a request for a given type of content, or would like a dashboard/highlight/other form of content for your own data, please [get in touch](/contact/) with the portal team to discuss it.
