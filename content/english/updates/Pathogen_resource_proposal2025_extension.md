**Submit a proposal via Anubis:** [Portal Resource Proposal call](https://anubis.scilifelab.se/call/PATHOGENS2025)

**Extended deadline for applications:** 2025-09-19 (15:00)

**Eligibility:** Uppsala University affiliation

The Swedish Pathogens Portal works closely with the research community to identify research outputs (e.g. data or tools), and technology/software that will be valuable for research efforts. These outputs are then promoted on the Swedish Pathogens Portal, ensuring that they are more findable for the research community.

The Swedish Pathogens Portal has now released a call for proposals for new resources on the portal. Through this [Portal Resource Proposal call](https://anubis.scilifelab.se/call/PATHOGENS2025), the portal aims to identify four large-scale use cases that will result in new resources beneficial to the research community. These use cases, at least one of which will involve sensitive human data, are expected to; (1) Provide new, substantial content for the portal that is of wide utility to the community, and (2) Define and develop new technical components that enable the portal to serve raw and processed data at a larger scale than today. Each resource will be provided with a unique URL and a two-year support plan to ensure sustainability. The Swedish Pathogens Portal will work closely with the research groups behind the proposals throughout the projects, and the resources will ultimately be made available via the portal.

Successful applicants will partner with the SciLifeLab Data Centre (DC) to plan and carry out the project. DC will provide project leadership and developers. Partner projects are expected to provide scientific content and research outputs, which may include the results of ongoing projects that have already yielded findings. Please note that no personnel or resources will be directly allocated to the applicant. Rather, the objective and benefit for the successful applicant is to have a bespoke data resource for their scientific results developed and embedded in the Swedish Pathogens Portal.

This call is open only to researchers at Uppsala University. More than one proposal can be submitted from each research group. The deadline for proposals to be submitted is 2025-09-19 (15:00). The services should be made available via the portal no later than the end of 2025. The proposals will be reviewed by the DC management group.
