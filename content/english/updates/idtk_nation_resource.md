We are very happy to announce the publication of the [Swedish national page](https://www.infectious-diseases-toolkit.org/national-resources/sweden) on the [Infectious Diseases Toolkit (IDTk)](https://www.infectious-diseases-toolkit.org).

The Infectious Diseases Toolkit (IDTk) is being developed as part of the [BeYond-COVID (BY-COVID) project](https://by-covid.org/). The €12 million project is funded by Horizon Europe and was launched in 2021. For more information on the project, please see our [previous news release](/updates/by-covid/), our [about page](/about/partner_organisations/) or the [BY-COVID website](https://by-covid.org/).

[SciLifeLab Data Centre](https://scilifelab.se/data/), who operates the COVID-19 and Pandemic Preparedness Portal, is a partner in the project. We work in particular on building the [Infectious Diseases Toolkit (IDTk)](https://www.infectious-diseases-toolkit.org), together with various collaborators in the BY-COVID consortium. The Infectious Disease Toolkit is a community effort to highlight best practice and and showcase solutions to data challenges affecting the response to infectious diseases outbreaks. It will include pages detailing best practice for data management for four main topic areas (pathogen characterisation, socioeconomic data, human biomolecular data, and human clinical and health data), as well as showcases, national resources, and resource lists. In each of the four topic areas, there are individual pages on different parts of the data life cycle (e.g. data description, data analysis, and data communication). The showcase pages describe individual resources or efforts, largely produced during the COVID-19 pandemic, that could potentially be repurposed for use in future pandemics. The national resources pages provide a general overview of resources, tools, and information related to the management of infectious disease data in a given country. The aim of these pages is ultimately to promote greater information exchange between countries so that everyone can benefit from each other’s experiences.

The [Swedish national page](https://www.infectious-diseases-toolkit.org/national-resources/sweden) is the first national resources page on the IDTk. It includes information on multiple topics including; health authorities, disease surveillance initiatives, dashboards and visualisation platforms, national data sources, regulations, and information on domain-specific infrastructures or resources. All of the information on the page is centred on infectious disease data.

As mentioned, the IDTk is a community effort, and we are looking for contributors. If you would like to add anything to an existing page, or even a whole new page, please do not hesitate to get in touch, either via the [IDTk](https://www.infectious-diseases-toolkit.org/contribute/) or by [contacting us in the Swedish Portal team](/contact/).
