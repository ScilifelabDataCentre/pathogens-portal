We have published a new [Editorial](/editorials/), entitled [“Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance – flying blind or flying behind?”](/editorials/environmental_amr_surveillance). As with all editorial articles, this is an opinion-style piece discussing currenting thinking in a research area. In this case, the topic is the environmental monitoring of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

This latest editorial is written by Johan Bengtsson-Palme, a DDLS fellow at Chalmers University, who is part of the Swedish Pathogens Portal's [editorial committee](/about/editorial_committee/). It discusses the value of monitoring the spread of antimicrobial resistance, as well as the potential complexities surrounding how this could be done, particularly in light of upcoming EU legislation.

Two upcoming fora are also relevant to those interested in this discussion. The first is the [DDLS Symposium on Data-Driven Environmental Monitoring of Infectious Disease](https://www.scilifelab.se/event/ddls-symposium-on-data-driven-environmental-monitoring-of-infectious-diseases/) on 7th-8th October in Uppsala. The second a workshop organised by [CARe](https://www.gu.se/en/care) on the theme of [sewage surveillance of antibiotic resistance focusing on the new EU requirements](https://www.gu.se/en/event/workshop-sewage-surveillance-of-antibiotic-resistance-new-eu-requirements-how-when-and-most-importantly-why) on 28th October in Gothenburg.
