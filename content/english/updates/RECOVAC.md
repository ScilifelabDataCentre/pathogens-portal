The *Swedish COVID-19 & Pandemic Preparedness Data Portal* is launching a new [dashboard](https://www.covid19dataportal.se/dashboards/). This latest dashboard is centred around register-based data from the [RECOVAC project](https://www.gu.se/en/research/recovac) (Register-based large-scale national population study to monitor COVID-19 vaccination effectiveness and safety). The project is led by **Prof. Fredrik Nyberg (University of Gothenburg)**, and is funded by both the *SciLifeLab/KAW COVID-19 National Research Program* and *VetenskapsrÃ¥det*. The ['RECOVAC dashboard'](https://www.covid19dataportal.se/dashboards/recovac/) contains information about the project (e.g. how to make data access requests and the methodology used), as well as visualisations of data from the project.

The **RECOVAC project**, a register-based national population study, uses an observational research approach to monitor the effectiveness and safety of COVID-19 vaccinations. The RECOVAC project also evaluates the adverse effects of vaccination, and assesses whether they covary with other patient traits.

The new dashboard is generally subdivded into two sections; data related to the adult population in Sweden overall, and data specifically related to those diagnosed with specific comorbidities in Sweden. For the general adult population, we visualise vaccination coverage and the number of admissions to intensive care units (ICU). This data is subdivided by age range (> 18 years, 18-59 years, > 60 years) as well as vaccine dose level (no doses - four doses). By contrast, we visualise vaccination coverage and the number of COVID-19 cases for those disgnosed with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, respiratory disease, and/or cancer. All visualisation are highly interactive, allowing users to explore the data and examine the aspects most of interest to them. For example, it is possible to view data for patients within certain age groups, patients that have received a given vaccination dose level, or within a specific period of time.

New data will be provided to the portal team by the RECOVAC project every 1-3 months. The visualisations on the dashboard will be updated as quickly as possible after data is made available. Data is currently available up until late Dec 2021. Not all data is available for exactly the same period of time, but it is possible to align the timeframes of comparable datasets.

*The Swedish COVID-19 & Pandemic Preparedness Portal invites other researchers affiliated to a Swedish university or research institute to contact us about featuring their work. We are happy to work with you produce pages/dashboards on projects focused on infectious diseases (including COVID-19), pandemic preparedness, or antibiotic resistance. You can get in touch by sending an email to <datacentre@scilifelab.se> or using our [contact form](https://www.covid19dataportal.se/contact/).*
