Today we release the next stage of the ongoing update to our dashboard related to [wastewater-based epidemiology in Sweden](/dashboards/wastewater/introduction/). Specifically, we have relased a new tab for data related to the [quantification of enteric viruses](/dashboards/wastewater/enteric_quantification/). The data and other information featured on this new tab was collected by the Norder group at Gothenburg University (GU). The data is visualised in a similar way to that on the [SARS-Cov-2 quantification pages](/dashboards/wastewater/covid_quantification/), which have long been a part of that the wastewater epidemiology dashboard. The data on the new [enteric viruses tab](/dashboards/wastewater/enteric_quantification/) can be used to determine whether there might be a potential outbreak of one or more of the viruses in Gothenburg (which is the area explored by the group).

Enteric viruses are a large group of viruses including, for example, calicivirus (including norovirus and sapovirus), adenoviruses, and polioviruses. In particular, the Norder group mointors enterovirus, adenoviruses, GG2 (the so-called 'winter vomiting disease' virus), astroviruses, and sapovirus. Basic information about the viruses and the symptoms that they cause is [available on the page](/dashboards/wastewater/enteric_quantification/#basic-virus-information).

This new section of the wastewater epidemiology dashboard is a part of our work to add data and information about pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2 to our dashboard. It reflects the change in our scope (i.e. to include general pandemic preparedness, rather than focusing ony on COVID-19) as it shows how similar methods can be used to monitor different pathogens, and to handle, analyse, and share data related to different pathogens. In the coming months, we will add more data and information about other pathogens to the Portal, so watch this space!

The new section is also part of our latest [topic](/topics/), namely [enteric viruses](/topics/enteric-virus/). The 'topics' buttons at the top of our website can be used to filter all of the content for information related to that topic.

If you would like to contribute to the Portal, or make a suggestion about new content/features, please do not hesitate to [get in touch](/contact/).
