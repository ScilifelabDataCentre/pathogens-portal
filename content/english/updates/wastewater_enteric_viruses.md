Today we release the next stage of the ongoing update to our [wastewater-based epidemiology in Sweden dashboard](/dashboards/wastewater/introduction/). Specifically, we have relased a new tab for data on [Enteric virus quantification (GU)](/dashboards/wastewater/enteric_quantification/). The data and other information featured on this new tab was collected by the Norder group at Gothenburg University (GU). The data is visualised in a similar way to that on the [SARS-Cov-2 quantification pages](/dashboards/wastewater/covid_quantification/) that are part of the wastewater-based epidemiology in Sweden dashboard.

Enteric viruses are a large group of viruses including, for example, calicivirus (including norovirus and sapovirus), adenoviruses, and polioviruses. In particular, the Norder group mointors enterovirus, adenoviruses, GG2 (the so-called 'winter vomiting disease' virus), astroviruses, and sapovirus. Basic information about the viruses is [available on the page](/dashboards/wastewater/enteric_quantification/#basic-virus-information), so that you can learn more about what they do. You can use the data on each virus to determine whether there is likely to be an outbreak of one or more of these viruses in Gothenburg.

This new section of the dashboard is a crucial part of our work to continue to expand the Portal to include information about viruses other than SARS-CoV-2. It reflects the change in our scope to include general pandemic preparedness as it shows how similar methods can be used to track different of pathogens, and to process and share that data in order to track outbreaks. In the coming months, we anticipate the addition of more data and information on more pathogens, so watch this space!

The new section is also part of our latest [topic](/topics/), namely [enteric viruses](/topics/enteric-virus/). The 'topics' buttons at the top of our website can be used to filter all of the content for information related to that topic.
