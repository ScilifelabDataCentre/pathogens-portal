We have published a new editorial in our [Editorials section](/editorials/).
Our editorials are short, opinion-style pieces reflecting the ‘current thinking’ on a topic related to infectious disease and pandemic preparedness.

This latest editorial, entitled [“Micro(bioterrorism) leveraging genomic data to improve anthrax surveillance”](/editorials/microbioterrorism) discusses _Bacillus anthracis_; a pathogen known as the cause of the life-threatening disease anthrax, and a known biological threat. _Bacillus anthracis_ does, however, also naturally occur in soil and can infect lifestock such as cattle, goat, and sheep. The focus of this Editorial is a discussion on how researchers are using surveillance and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data to proactively study such pathogens.

The editorial was written by Laura Carroll, a DDLS fellow at Umeå University, who is part of the Swedish Pathogens Portal's [editorial committee](/about/editorial_committee/).

If you are interested in writing an editorial for the portal, please [contact the portal team](/contact/).
We will contact you as soon as possible to discuss your suggestion.
