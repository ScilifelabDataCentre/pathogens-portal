We have published a novel editorial in our [Editorials section](/editorials/).
Our editorials are short, opinion-style pieces reflecting the ‘current thinking’ on a topic related to infectious disease and pandemic preparedness.

This latest editorial, entitled [“Micro(bioterrorism) leveraging genomic data to improve anthrax surveillance”](/editorials/microbioterrorism) discusses Bacillus Anthracis, a pathogen known as the cause of the life-threatening disease Anthrax and is known as a biological threat.
But it also occurs naturally in soil and can infect lifestock such as cattle, goat, and sheep.
The focus on this Editorial is to discuss how researchers are using surveillance and WGS data to proactively study Anthracis pathogens.
The editorial was written by Laura Carroll, DDLS fellow at Umeå University who is part of our editorial committee.

We will contact you as soon as possible to discuss your suggestion.
