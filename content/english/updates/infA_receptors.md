title: "New data highlight on the incompatablility of receptors in influenza A transmission"
date: 2024-05-14
summary: Nilsson et al. showed that sialylated glycan structures that were previously thought to be exclusive to mammals were present in avian species. Mass spectrometry proteomics shared openly.

The latest [data highlight](/highlights/), entitled ['New study increases understanding of receptor incompatibility in transmission of influenza A virus between species'](/highlights/receptor_incompatability_infa/) is the first related to our [influenza topic](/topics/influenza/). As with all data highlights, it showcases research that openly shares data and/or code. In this case, Nilsson _et al._ (2024) have openly shared mass spectrometry proteomics data in the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository (dataset identifier: [PXD036263](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD036263)).

Nilsson _et al_. (2024), originally published in Glycobiology (DOI: [10.1093/glycob/cwad098](https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwad098)), aimed to better understand interspecies transmission of the influenza A virus (IAV). Specifically, they used glycoprotein analysis to investigate linkage conformation of sialic acid-containing glycans, which serve as receptors for IAVs. Nilsson _et al_. (2024) ultimately showed that complex sialic acid-containing structures were not, as previously thought, specific to mammals. Indeed, they were present in all 3 avian species considered. These results could have major implications for understanding receptor incompatibility and interspecies spread of IAVs, as well as for zoonotic ecology.
