summary: The scope of the portal has expanded in 2022 to include other pathogens and pandemic preparedness in general. We've created lots of new content and features in response to this (with more planned!).

### Our new look

The COVID-19 and Pandemic Preparedness Portal is one of the pillars of the [SciLifeLab Pandemic Laboratory Preparedness (PLP) Program](https://www.scilifelab.se/capabilities/pandemic-laboratory-preparedness/). When the portal joined the PLP program in 2022, the scope of the portal expanded to include diseases other than COVID-19 and pandemic preparedness in general. Multiple new sections have now been added to the Portal to reflect this change in scope. For example, last month we added our [Pandemic Preparedness section](/resources/) which showcases projects that are part of the PLP program, many of whom we have already collaborated with for a long time. We have also added more [topics](/topics/) to the Portal, which can be used to filter content according to an element related to pandemic preparedness.

We've rearranged our menus and our home page to make sorting things easier. Now, available data, data highlights, and research data management (RDM) advice can all be found in our 'available data, highlights, and RDM' menu. All pandemic preparednes resources are now found under 'Pandemic Preparedness'. For now, this section mostly includes information related to the projects involved in the PLP Program, but it will be expanded in future to include other relevant resources. Check out our new features and [let us know what you think](/contact/).

### Other important updates

As many of you already know, we make regular updates to many of our dashboards. For example, [vaccine data](/dashboards/vaccines/) is updated weekly on Friday mornings, and data related to [post COVID-19 condition](/dashboards/post_covid/) is updated monthly. We're going to be adding more information to some of our dashboards in the coming months, and hope to also include new dashboards related to different pathogens.

The available data section has now been updated. In this update, as well as adding the latest data & code from publications, we've added some new features. Specifically, the format of data and code items in the table has been updated to include more detail and we've also linked a script we use to automatically find the available data. This section will now be updated monthly in the first week of the month.

### Things to look out for

In the coming months, we will be starting to establish a new editorial committee that will work closely with us to produce new content that is most relevant to the research community. Watch out for news on that in our [news](/updates/) page, for example.

Many of the PLP projects will be presenting at [The State of the Art COVID-19 conference](https://stateoftheart.se/). At this conference, the community involved in COVID-19 research in Sweden will gather for two days (16-17 November) to discuss their work. The conference is entirely digital. It will involve national and international speakers, many talks and a poster session. [Registration](https://stateoftheart.se/registration/) is still open, so we hope to see you there.
