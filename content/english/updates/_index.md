In this section, we report major pieces of news related to the Portal. This can include, for example, new pages, new/improved features, or important progress in the field of pandemic preparedness in Sweden.

We will not detail all updates here, though. For example, we will not include infromation about updates to data/dashboards that occur at least monthly. We also do not inform about each new data highlight/funding opportunity/project/publication update in this section.
