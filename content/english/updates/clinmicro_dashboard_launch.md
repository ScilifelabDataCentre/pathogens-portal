Today we are launching a new data [dashboard](/dashboards/) built in collaboration with researchers at Uppsala University Hosiptal.

Researchers at the section for [Clinical Microbiology and Hospital Hygiene at Uppsala University Hospital](https://www.akademiska.se/en/departments/departments/klinisk-mikrobiologi-och-vardhygien/) have been conducting surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in the Uppsala region throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. They receive samples from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in the Uppsala region, and perform whole genome sequencing on them to determine the variants/strains of SARS-CoV-2 causing the infections. To date, they have sequenced over 12,000 samples from Uppsala. The dashboard is available in both [English](/dashboards/variants_region_uppsala/) and [Swedish](/sv/dashboards/variants_region_uppsala/) versions.

This [new dashboard](/dashboards/variants_region_uppsala) shows the data that they have collected throughout the pandemic and to the present day. The dashboard shows two visualisations that show sequence data classified according to the WHO labels and/or Pango lineages for SARS-CoV-2 variants. In the first visualisation, more granular information about the sequences detected during 2023 are shown. In the second, data is shown throughout the time period that sequences have been analysed, and broader categories of classification are used. Information is also given about who to contact regarding the data and project, and relevant publications from the research group. The data in the dashboard will be updated approximately weekly.

In future, we hope to expand the data shown by this group and others doing similar work across Sweden. If you are interested in having your work featured on a dashboard, please [get in touch](/contact/) with the portal team to discuss it.
