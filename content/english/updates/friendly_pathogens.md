We have now published a third editorial in our [Editorials section](/editorials/). Our editorials are short, opinion style pieces reflecting the 'current thinking' on a topic related to infectious disease and pandemic preparedness.

This latest editorial, entitled ["“Feed a gut, and starve a fever” or friendly vs disease-causing pathogens"](/editorials/friendly_deadly_pathogens) discusses what makes a pathogen, with a focus on how we, as hosts, interact with different microbes. Whilst we may be accustomed to thinking as pathogens as purely disease causing agents, many of the same microbes can be beneficial to us, and only cause disease in particular circumstances. The editorial also talks about microbial diversity indifferent parts of our bodies and how that relates to our health. The editorial was written by Luisa W Hugerth, a DDLS fellow at Uppsala University who is part of the Portal Editorial Committee.
