We have published a third editorial in our [Editorials section](/editorials/). Our editorials are short, opinion-style pieces reflecting the 'current thinking' on a topic related to infectious disease and pandemic preparedness.

This latest editorial, entitled ["“Feed a gut, and starve a fever” or friendly vs disease-causing pathogens"](/editorials/friendly_deadly_pathogens) discusses what makes a pathogen, with a focus on how we, as hosts, interact with different microbes. The portal focuses on disease causing agents, but it is important to remember that the capacity for a microbe to cause disease can depend on the interplay between host and microbe. The editorial also talks about microbial diversity in different parts of our bodies and how that relates to our health. The editorial was written by Luisa W. Hugerth, a DDLS fellow at Uppsala University who is part of our editorial committee.

If you are interested in writing an editorial for the portal, please [contact the portal team](/contact/). We will contact you as soon as possible to discuss your suggestion.
