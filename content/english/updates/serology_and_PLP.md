Our latest dashboard discusses updates from one of SciLifeLab's Pandemic Laboratory Preparedness (PLP) capabilities: [multi-disease serology](/resources/serology/). The [multi-disease serology dashboard](/dashboards/multidisease_serology/) shows proteins created at KTH that are related to viruses including SARS-CoV-2, influenza, RSV, adenovirus, and Mpox. It also shows antigens that have been produced externally as the PLP capability expands to work with flavivirus and herpesvirus.

The release of this dashboard coincides with updates to the existing dashboard on [Serology tests for SARS-CoV-2 at SciLifeLab](/dashboards/serology-statistics/). The dashboard shows the number of serology tests conducted at SciLifeLab's Autoimmunology and Serology Profiling unit since early 2020. This includes the number of tests that were positive for SARS-CoV-2, the number that were negative, and the number that were used for research and development.

There have also been updates to the [Pandemic Laboratory Preparedness Capabilities section](/resources/), which shows projects that are related to SciLifeLab's Pandemic Laboratory Preparedness (PLP) Program.
