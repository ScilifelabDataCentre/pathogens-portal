title: New dashboard on predicting the next dominant strain of SARS-CoV-2
date: 2024-09-04
summary: "The latest dashboard: “SARS-CoV-2 variant competition” on the Portal features the results of a model capable of predicting the variant of SARS-CoV-2 that's likely to become dominant based on geographical statistics."

Today we are launching a new data dashboard, called [SARS-CoV-2 variant competition](/dashboards/lineage_competition/). The dashboard, built in collaboration with researchers at Karolinska Institutet, features a model that can predict which variant of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be the next to become dominant globally, and in different regions, such as Sweden. In particular, the model integrates SARS-CoV-2 genotype sequencing data from around the world to estimate the growth advantage of different variants. This is then used to provide regional estimates of variant frequencies and how these are changing over time.

The dashbord is likely to be most useful to researchers that want to know which variants to focus on next in their studies, and public health officials that want to know which variants are likely to become dominant in their region.

The Swedish Pathogens Portal continuously searches for ways to accelerate research. Data dashboards are one way in which we do this, we also write data highlights and build resources that researchers need to continue with their work. If you are interested in having your work featured on a data dashboard with customised, dynamic visualisations to represent data, or maybe in a different type of resource, please get in touch with the portal team to discuss it.
