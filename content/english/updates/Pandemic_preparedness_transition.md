Today, we are formally relaunching as the ‘COVID-19 and Pandemic Preparedness Data Portal’. This change in title reflects an expansion in our scope. Instead of focusing solely on COVID-19, we will now consider pandemic preparedness in general and will thus collate and promote resources that could be beneficial for future pandemics. This does not mean that we will stop including resources related to COVID-19. On the contrary, the resources developed for COVID-19 are likely to be of vital importance in future pandemic preparedness, and we aim to highlight this as much as possible.

We have been transitioning the site throughout 2022 and have developed multiple new features that relate to pandemic preparedness. For example, we have established our [‘emerging diseases’ section](/pathogens/) as a means of quickly bringing attention to resources related to new potential threats. One of our key new elements is our [‘Resources’ section](/resources/), where we showcase resources related to pandemic preparedness.

At present, the resources primarily include information about capabilities funded by the [SciLifeLab Pandemic Laboratory Preparedness (PLP) Program](https://www.scilifelab.se/capabilities/pandemic-laboratory-preparedness/). We will continue to expand this section by adding new resources and information over time. If you are aware of a resource that you think should be featured here and isn’t, or want to make comments/suggestions about our latest sections, please [get in touch](/contact/).

In the coming months, we'll be looking into changing the visual identity of the Portal in order to align with other European pandemic preparedness resources.
