Today, we are launching our new [editorials section](/editorials/). The editorials published in this section will be on topics related to infectious disease and pandemic preparedness. Editorials are short, opinion-style articles that describe the 'current thinking' on a given topic. They might, for example, highlight scientific break-throughs, comment on recent developments, or discuss the future of a given area of study. The editorials in this section could be written by members of the portal team, editorial committee, or wider Swedish research community.

We are initiating this section with two editorials. One editorial is a discussion on the [potential for influenza viruses to trigger future pandemics, and how research can prepare for this](/editorials/influenza). It was written by [Mahmoud Naguib](https://www.katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N17-1318), a researcher working on influenza at Uppsala University. The other editorial is a comment on [data sharing throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2023 Nobel Prize in Medicine](/editorials/pandemic_data_sharing). It was written by [Katarina Ã–jefors Stark](https://www.katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N0-579), a member of the portal team.

If you are interested in writing an editorial for the portal, please [contact the portal team](/contact/). We will contact you as soon as possible to discuss your suggestion.
