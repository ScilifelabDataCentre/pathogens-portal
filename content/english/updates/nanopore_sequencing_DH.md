The latest [data highlight](/highlights/), entitled [‘Automated GUI-based workflows improve accessibility of SARS-CoV-2 Nanopore data analysis’](/highlights/nanopore_sequencing/), contributes to our growing collection on COVID-19 diagnostics and pandemic preparedness. As with all data highlights, it showcases research that openly shares data and/or tools. In this case, researchers at Uppsala University Hospital developed and validated two automated workflows within Geneious Prime, a graphical software platform, to streamline SARS-CoV-2 Oxford Nanopore sequencing analysis.

The study, originally published in [International Journal of Molecular Sciences](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25126645), provides a practical solution for labs with limited programming capacity. The [workflows]( https://github.com/clinical-genomics-uppsala/Geneious_SARS-CoV-2) perform trimming, alignment, consensus sequence generation, and, in the advanced version, phylogenetic lineage assignment using pangolin and Nextclade as integrated plugins. These user-friendly workflows are already deployed in Sweden’s national SARS-CoV-2 surveillance program and have been validated across Linux, macOS, and Windows systems. Importantly, they have reduced analysis time while preserving diagnostic accuracy.

Validation data and tools are openly available via [GitHub](https://github.com/clinical-genomics-uppsala/Geneious_SARS-CoV-2) and the Sequence Read Archive (Accession: PRJNA1048178), ensuring others can adopt or adapt the workflows for different pathogens and outbreak scenarios.
