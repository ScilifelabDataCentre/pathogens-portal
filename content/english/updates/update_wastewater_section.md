Today, we are thrilled to release the first stage of the update of our [wastewater-based epidemiology in Sweden dashboard](/dashboards/wastewater/introduction/).

The dashboard will still contain data and information related to the [quantification of the SARS-CoV-2 virus](/dashboards/wastewater/covid_quantification/), which has been popular with users from the start! However, it will now be clearer which data is provided by which research group, and how each group conducts their research.

Previously, data was provided by two groups; the [SEEC (The Swedish Environmental Epidemiology Center)](https://www.scilifelab.se/pandemic-response/pandemic-laboratory-preparedness/swedish-environmental-epidemiology-center-seec/) nodes at KTH Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), and Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU). Now, data is also being provided by the Norder group at Gothenburg university (GU). In order to find out more about the areas tested by the different groups, see our [quantification of SARS-CoV-2 virus page](/dashboards/wastewater/covid_quantification/), as well as the individual pages detailing the work done by each of the groups contributing data to the dashboard: [SLU](/dashboards/wastewater/covid_quant_slu/), [KTH](/dashboards/wastewater/covid_quant_kth/), and [GU](/dashboards/wastewater/covid_quant_gu/).

In the coming months, we will be further expanding this dashboard. Not only do we expect to have more data on SARS-CoV-2, but we also anticipate more data on other diseases. This highlights how similar methods can be used to track different of pathogens, and to process and share that data. This is key to future pandemic preparedness, which is what this portal is all about!
