The Editorials are short opinion-style pieces centred around topics related to pandemic preparedness. They can be written by members of the [Portal team](/about/), the [editorial committee](/about/editorial_committee/), or researchers affiliated with a Swedish research organisation. The goal of the editorials is to show the ‘current thinking’ in a given area.

To easily find editorials relevant to a specific topic, click on the tags shown on the thumbnails. The page will filter and display only the editorials related to that topic. You can also use the search bar to find editorials of potential interest.
