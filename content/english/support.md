All researchers affiliated with a university or research institute in Sweden working on research topics relevant to pandemic preparedness can receive free individual consultations and hands-on help within reasonable bounds from the *Swedish COVID-19 & Pandemic Preparedness Portal* team. Simply send an email to datacentre@scilifelab.se. Your question will be assigned to a data steward with relevant expertise who can either help you directly or point you to the correct tool or service.

You are welcome to send both general questions about best approaches to research data management, data management plans (DMPs), reproducibility, FAIR, and open science as well as specific questions about your research projects such as which repository to choose to deposit data, what the suitable metadata standards would be, which file formats to use, etc. In some cases the data stewards can act as brokers and submit data to repositories on your behalf.

The [COVID-NL clinical data]([https://snd.gu.se/en](https://covid19initiatives.health-ri.nl/p/Dashboard)) has a primary function to support the accessibility, preservation, and re-use of clinical data. Health-RI provides services for researchers to share and access research data from all research areas.

"The COVID-NL clinical data consists of data collected on patients with a (suspected) COVID-19 infection by multiple hospitals throughout the Netherlands. The main objective is to assist researchers in their respective organisation in making research data as accessible as possible, in accordance with the FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable). This includes to offer training and support to researchers in data management and accessibility, as well as to publish the researchersâ€™ metadata in the COVID-NL data catalogue, and to ensure secure storage of the data. Further information on data access can be found [here](https://elsi.health-ri.nl/sites/elsi/files/2022-03/HRI_COVID-NL%20policy%20doc%20v2.0%20final.pdf) "
