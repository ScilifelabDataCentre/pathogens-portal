## Background and nomenclature for SARS CoV-2 variants

SARS-CoV-2 is part of the group of *RNA viruses*. The RNA viruses are known for fast mutation rates and for resilience to antiviral drugs. A virus variant can have one, or more, mutations that differentiate it from other virus variants circulating in a population.
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2020 a number of variants have emerged in different part of the world. While the research community and governmental health agencies are monitoring all variants that have emerged, some variants are given more attention and monitored more closely due to their attributes and characteristics. The research community has used [Pango](https://cov-lineages.org), [Nextstrain]( https://nextstrain.org ) and [GISAID](https://www.gisaid.org ) nomenclature to distinguish these new variant. However, in May 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed to use [labels from the Greek alphabet for naming SARS CoV-2 variants](https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/=) to be used, alongside the scientific nomenclature, when communicating for the public. To-date Omicron is the latest variant designated a Greek letter.

[*The European Centre for Disease Control*](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en ) are dividing the SARS-CoV-2 virus variants into:

* *Variant of Concern* (*VOC*)
* *Variant of Interest* (*VOI*)
* *Variant under monitoring* (*VUM*)

##### Variant of concern

A *Variant of concern* (*VOC*) have clear information that indicates that the variant will *impact how fast the variant can be transmitted, severity of the disease, and/or immunity, , which can have effect on the epidemiological situation in a society.* Available research about the *VOC* could also be indicating *vaccine escape* (significant reduced neutralizing effect by antibodies generated from vaccination), or decreased vaccine protection from severe disease. In addition, a SARS-CoV-2 *VOC* could also have proved hard to detect using standard diagnostic assays that has previously been used for other variants and therefore more difficult to track. In current *VOCs* in Sweden are: **Beta**, **Gamma**, **Delta**, and **Omicron**.

##### Variant of Interest

For a *Variant of Interest* (*VOI*) there is evidence, though preliminary or not yet confirmed, indicating that for example these variants could have genetic markers suggested or predicted to affect *transmission*, evidence of impact on *severity* and /or *immunity*, or *diagnostics*. A variant of interest could also be a new variant that has been connected to a large outbreak.
ECDC also adds that a VOI should *“…realistically having an impact on the epidemiological situation in the EU/EEA…”*

##### Variant of Monitoring (VOM)

A *Variant under monitoring* (*VOM*) may have properties that could indicate similarities to known VOCs. The data about these could come from epidemiological monitoring, screening or preliminary research data.

In summary, increased knowledge about *SARS-CoV-2 variants* is important for detecting and monitoring spread of the disease and local outbreaks. Research into present-day SARS-CoV-2 variants may contribute to earlier detection of new variants, understanding national and regional trends in spread, as well as comparing virus variants. In addition, the research community may also contribute important real-time data to support policymakers and government in healthcare planning, development of i.e., for non- pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) (such as i.e., personal protective measures, environmental measures, physical distancing, and travel related measures), and other measures to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Over the last two years the research community has, in record time, increase the knowledge and understanding about the new SARS-CoV-2 virus, and by continuing this work contributes to societies future pandemic preparedness.

The key mutations in B.1.1.7 are found in the spike protein, there are eight mutations in the spike area. As three spike proteins form a spike on the SARS-CoV-2 all the mutation are found in three positions. A number of other mutations are also found throughout the genome. The spike mutations of interest are N501Y, D614G, P681H.
* The first cases were detected in Sweden in the end of December 2020.
* The variant B.1.1.7 has according the **Swedish Public Health Agency** became the predominant strain in most counties (April 2021) but today Dec 2021 is has been drastically decreased since Delta started to spread.

* Evidence of impact on *immunity* [Pulliam et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.11.212660689).
To-date preliminary result from an in vitro study by [Cele et al](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.08.21267417v1) focused on neutralizing capacity of antibodies from convalescent or post-vaccination sera against the new Omicron variant show a reduced neutralisation capacity when investigating sera from both vaccinated and recovered patients., compared to other SARS CoV-2 variants.
* In the first preliminary results from a Swedish study of a cohort random blood donors (N=17), the mean fold-reduction was around 7, indicating that Omicron has increased neutralisations compared to the Delta variant [Ben Murrell @BenjMurrell, 2021-12-07](https://twitter.com/BenjMurrell/status/1468341478363746310) and referenced in Nature News [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03672-3) and available as a preprint [Steward et al. 2021](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CuxmNYj5cpIuxWXhjjVmuDqntxXwlfXQ/view).
