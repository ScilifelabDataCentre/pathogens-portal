    host_organisation: KTH Royal Institute of Technology
    use: "Each pandemic and epidemic, currently as in the past, has presented as a public health emergency characterised by uncertainty in the entity of its effect. A key point of pandemic preparedness is therefore to be able to learn from the past by collecting as much virological and immunological data as possible on viruses causing diseases with pandemic potential. Comparative serological studies and serological surveillance are well needed in order to understand the extent and duration of the immune response in COVID-19 and future pandemics."
    access: "The resource is available to both academia and industry [through the Autoimmunity and Serology Profiling Unit at SciLifeLab](https://www.scilifelab.se/units/autoimmunity-profiling/). Applicants can submit a project proposal through the unit website to initiate discussion on feasibility and fees."

High-throughput serology analysis is an important tool for evaluating the serostatus and potential immunity of the population. The information provided can both monitor the spread of a disease and aid in making informed decisions regarding efficient societal restrictions and vaccination strategies. A critical concern for performing high-throughput serology, especially during a pandemic, is continuous access to the required reagents.

During spring 2020, a highly performing, high-throughput and multiplex SARS-CoV-2 serology assay was in short time developed by a multidisciplinary team from KTH and SciLifeLab, also involving multiple actors within public, commercial, and healthcare sectors. The fast development of this new platform was enabled through combining already established protein production expertise and workflows at KTH, IT expertise at SciLifeLab, and the existing infrastructure of the Autoimmunity and Serology Profiling Facility. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the assay was used to analyse almost 200Â 000 plasma and serum samples within several research efforts. The current workflow covers the analysis pipeline from plasma or serum sample processing to data analysis and generation of multiplex serological profiles against SARS-CoV-2. All viral proteins are produced in house, which enables a flexible adaptation of the pipeline to new versions of the virus as well as entirely new infectious agents.

The resource will provide an expanded serology workflow to cover more infectious agents in a multiplex fashion. In parallel, it will allow also for testing of different sample types immunoglobulin subtypes.
