In order to allow molecular analysis of emerging biological threats, early access to biological samples is warranted. During the early stages of SARS-COVID-19 pandemic, lack of relevant clinical samples was a limiting factor. This project aims to create units, early pandemic sample center, that allows rapid biological specimen handling to connecting SciLifeLab facilities with university hospitals. In order to try out this model, Karolinska and Uppsala University  Hospitals will be used as trials. 

The plan is to set up two sample flows:

* The first sample flow will connect Infectious Disease clinics including Biosafety laboratory (level-3) to allow handling any type of infections material for neutralising and further analysis.

* The second sample flow will connect the hospital laboratories and Pathology units to allow collection and preparation of patient samples needed for analysis. The samples will be used to increase the understanding of  the causes and symptoms of novel diseases, as well as for studies of the immune and organ response to novel viruses, and for the treatment response.

The project will gather standard operation procedures (SOPs) for DNA, RNA, protein, cell and tissue analysis from SciLifeLab. Procedures for pseudonymisation and healthcare biobanking will also be made available.
