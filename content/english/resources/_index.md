## Overview

[To be added here: short paragraph on why pandemic preparedness is important.]

This section of the Portal describes resources in Sweden that have been built and are available for research into current and potential future pandemics. We primarily describe resources that are a part of the [Pandemic Laboratory Preparedness program at SciLifeLab](https://www.scilifelab.se/capabilities/pandemic-laboratory-preparedness/) (this program was commissioned by the government to run between 2021-2024) but resources outside of this program can also be added. We hope this section can help researchers working on topics relevant for pandemic preparedness find useful laboratories, tools, assays, protocols, collaborators, etc. for their research.

Please select a resource on the left (or top if you are viewing this page from a mobile screen) to see the details about that resource.

    <i class="bi bi-info-circle-fill"></i> Do you operate a resource that could be useful for research relevant for pandemic preparedness? We welcome suggestions for resources to be listed in this section, send us an email at <a href="mailto:datacentre@scilifelab.se">datacentre@scilifelab.se</a>.
