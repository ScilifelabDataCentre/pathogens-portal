title: Pandemic Preparedness Resources
---

## Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic began over 2 years ago. It had a tremendous, negative impact on society and healthcare systems globally. The speed of the response from all quarters was unprecedented, as was the level of cooperation within and around the scientific community. This helped to get the pandemic under control and prevent greater, more widespread damage. In order to minimise the impact of the next pandemic, we need to act to make sure that our response is as quick as possible. The best way to do this is to invest in pandemic preparedness now. Pandemic preparedness involves ensuring that the resources needed to fight a pandemic are ready for immediate use; preventing the need to invest significant time on development during the pandemic.

This section of the Portal is dedicted to resources related to pandemic preparedness (i.e. resources that can be used in current and future pandemics). At present, the resources listed are primarily related to the [Pandemic Laboratory Preparedness (PLP) program at SciLifeLab](https://www.scilifelab.se/capabilities/pandemic-laboratory-preparedness/) (refer to our [PLP program background page](/plp-program-background/) for additional information). However, any pandemic preparedness resources built by individuals associated with a Swedish university or research institute can be included.

The resources pages themselves are not static. They will be updated as soon as possible after more information becomes available on the resource(s).
