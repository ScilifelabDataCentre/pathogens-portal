title: Pandemic Preparedness Resources
---

## Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic began over 2 years ago. It had a tremendous, negative impact on society and healthcare systems globally. The speed of the response from all quarters was unprecedented, as was the level of cooperation within and around the scientific community. This undoubtedly lessened the impact of the pandemic. The best way to ensure that the response to the next pandemic is as swift as possible, and thus to minimise its impact, is to invest effort in pandemic preparedness. Pandemic preparedness involves ensuring that the resources needed to fight a pandemic are immediately available for use; minimising time spent on development.

This section of the Portal is dedicted to resources related to pandemic preparedness (i.e. resources that can be used in current and future pandemics). At present, the resources listed are primarily related to the [Pandemic Laboratory Preparedness (PLP) program at SciLifeLab](https://www.scilifelab.se/capabilities/pandemic-laboratory-preparedness/) (refer to our [PLP program background page](/plp-program-background/) for additional information). However, any pandemic preparedness resources built by individuals associated with a Swedish university or research institute can be included.
