Shotgun metagenomics is rapidly expanding as the technique of choice for identifying both well- known and new pathogens and their resistance mechanisms. The technique, especially through the introduction of long-read sequencing using Oxford Nanopore technology, are getting more affordable and rapid. The Dept. of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Microbiology, Örebro University Hospital has in collaboration with the Genomic Medicine Center Örebro and Clinical Genomics Örebro (SciLifeLab), several ongoing projects in this field. The pre-analytic conditions are, however, crucial to obtain reliable data from metagenomics analysis. So far there are limited data on the optimal sample matrix, transport conditions and nucleic extraction to get the optimal sequence quality for specimens from the upper respiratory tract.

The close collaboration between Clinical Microbiology and Genomic Medicine Center in Örebro is essential in the proposed study where we aim to study the pre-analytical requisites for a reliable detection of microorganisms and resistance markers in specimens from the upper airways.

For future pandemics, and for studies focusing on the silent pandemic of the of antibiotic resistance, we believe that an optimized pre-analytic standard operating procedure (SOP) for metagenomics detection of microorganisms and resistance in samples from the upper respiratory tract would be beneficial.
