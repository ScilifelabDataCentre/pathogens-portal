This collaborative project, including 6 PLP partners and the National Veterinary Institute (SVA) (see the [full list of participants](#list-of-participants) below), is designed to simulate an outbreak scenario by dispatching clinical samples that are spiked with unusual microorganisms to the contributing clinical microbiology laboratories. These samples are delivered in a manner that facilitates enrichment and mimick authentic patient and wastewater samples. The scenarios may encompass complex, potentially zoonotic outbreaks, thus embracing the One Health concept by engaging partners from both human and animal health.

All project phases will be meticulously documented, and progress updates on the outbreak scenario will be shared via the Swedish Pathogens Portal. This approach ensures real-time project monitoring and public accessibility to information.

The primary objectives include assessing response times and the laboratory's capacity to detect and identify the pathogen, developing diagnostic methods, treatment recommendations, but also scaling up sequencing, bioinformatics, and investigate storage capacities at the National Pandemic Center (NPC). The project leverages the synergistic effects of collaborations between laboratories. Participating laboratories will receive samples in a time series, emulating a natural pathogen distribution.

The project serves to evaluate pandemic preparedness effectiveness and identify areas for potential enhancement. Through these concerted efforts, this initiative aims to strengthen our collective capacity to respond swiftly and effectively to emerging infectious threats.
