SEEC is a national capacity-building center that bridges the current gap between epidemiology and environmental assessment. It provides for rapid and effective response to detected pathogens as well as population level epidemiology. SEEC also stands for the standardization of molecular and experimental methods for continuous assessment of known and emerging pathogens of concern in Sweden.

Our aim is to provide:

- Continued and extended wastewater-based monitoring of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic;
- Pathogen profiling of the built environment and expanded sampling capacity;
- Help for infection transmission risk assessment in public places;
- An accessible repository of environmental samples of public health relevance;
- Capacity for environmental epidemiology research and development.
