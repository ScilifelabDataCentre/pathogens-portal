The constant emergence and replacement of new _SARS-CoV-2 variants_ has shown the need for continuous large-scale surveillance to monitor for future pandemic threats. This project builds on established collaboration between _SciLifeLab_ and the _Karolinska University Laboratory_, and provide samples, data and expertise from Sweden’s largest microbiology laboratory. In addition, the structure is part of Genomic Medicine Sweden (GMS) which is ensuring the coordination with other national efforts.

The laboratory has established large-scale WGS of SARS-CoV-2. To-date 40,000+ samples sequenced and reported to [SMInet](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/smittskydd-beredskap/overvakning-och-rapportering/sminet/) and [GISAID](https://gisaid.org/) (capacity 500 WGS/week). The RAPI-SEQ project has generated several papers on SARS-CoV-2 variants and neutralisation.

Metagenomics has been established as a clinical diagnostic tool as well as preparedness for rapid identification of new pandemic threats.

This project involves two subprojects; taxprofiler and GMS Artic. Please see the [taxprofiler](/resources-subprojects/taxprofiler/) and [GMS Artic](/resources-subprojects/gms-arctic/) pages for more information (including information on access and usage).

**Specific project aims:**

1. An infrastructure for sample handling and sequencing, with access to BSL-2/3 labs, metadata, automation, etc.
2. High-capacity, short-read and long-read sequencing for rapid continuous surveillance of
   emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants linked with capacity for functional tests.
3. Establishment of a metagenomic assay for molecular surveillance of respiratory viruses
