The emergence of *SARS-CoV-2 VOCs* has shown the need for continuous large-
scale surveillance to monitor for future pandemic threats. This project builds on established collaboration between *SciLifeLab* and the *Karolinska University Laboratory*, and provide samples, data and expertise from  Sweden’s largest microbiology laboratory. In addition, the structure is part of Genomic Medicine Sweden (GMS) which is ensuring the coordination with other national efforts.

The laboratory has established large-scale WGS of SARS-CoV-2 (to-date 2000+ samples sequenced and reported to [SMInet]( https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/smittskydd-beredskap/overvakning-och-rapportering/sminet/ ). Current capacity: 500 WGS/ week). The project also aims to establish high-throughput, long-read sequencing of the SARS- CoV-2 spike gene, as well as capacity for neutralization assays of vaccine escape variants.

This project involved two subprojects; Taxprofiler and GMS Arctic. Please see the [Taxprofiler](/resources-subprojects/taxprofiler/) and [GMS Arctic](/resources-subprojects/gms-arctic/) pages for more information (including information on access and usage).

**Specific project aims:**

1. An infrastructure for sample handling and sequencing, with access to BSL-2/3 labs, metadata, automation, etc.
2. High-capacity, short-read and long-read sequencing for rapid continuous surveillance of
emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants linked with capacity for functional tests.  
3. Establishment of a metagenomic assay for molecular surveillance of respiratory viruses
