This resource involves three subprojects:

**1. Highly parallelised multi-taxonomic profiling of shotgun metagenomic data (taxprofiler)**

For more information on Taxprofiler (including information on access, use, and contact), please see the dedicated [Taxprofiler](/resources-subprojects/taxprofiler/).

**2. SARS-CoV-2 bioinformatics pipeline – GMS Arctic**

For more information on GMS Arctic (including information on access, use, and contact), please see the dedicated [GMS Arctic page](/resources-subprojects/gms-arctic/).

**3. SARS-CoV-2 Reporter for visualization of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence data (SC2reporter)**

For more information on SC2reporter (including information on access, use, and contact), please see the dedicated [SC2reporter page](/resources-subprojects/sc2reporter/).
