title: Pandemic Laboratory Preparedness (PLP) program
toc: true
---

The Science for Life Laboratory (SciLifeLab) research community has been actively engaged in national and international COVID-19 research from very early in the pandemic. The ability to access established SciLifeLab infrastructure and expertise within that research community undoubtedly expedited studies on *COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2* at the *molecular, cellular, patient, population, and environmental levels*.

As part of their efforts to tackle the pandemic, SciLifeLab was also quick to establish programs to support research efforts. The first was the [The SciLifeLab/KAW National COVID-19 Research Program](https://www.scilifelab.se/pandemic-response/covid-19-research-program/), which was established in April 2020 and cofunded by the [Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation (KAW)](https://kaw.wallenberg.org/stiftelsens-satsningar-pa-atgarder-mot-coronaviruset). More recently, SciLifeLab was commissoned to establish a program focussed on pandemic preparedness. Here, we provide background and relevant links related to the resultant research program; the Pandemic Laboratory Preparedness (PLP) program.

## Progress to date

In December 2020, the government [comissioned SciLifeLab to build capacity for future pandemics](https://www.regeringen.se/rattsliga-dokument/proposition/2020/12/forskning-frihet-framtid--kunskap-och-innovation-for-sverige/). The assignment broadly involved supporting **research related to infectious diseases** (e.g. in diagnostics, analysis of infection, immunity, and the development of resistance to therapies in pathogens), and building **competence** and developing **technologies** related to pandemic research (e.g. in sequencing, genetic analysis, immunology, and big data). The services/tools/resources (termed 'capabilities') established through this program are intended to assist and complement those elsewhere in society (e.g. authorities, municipalities and regions) to tackle future pandemics. As such, the PLP program will work in close consultation with governmental agencies, e.g. [Swedish Public Health Agency (FoHM)](www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se).

In February 2021, the PLP program sent out a national open call for letters of intent to develop capabilities (tools/resources/services) for detecting and monitoring COVID-19, and to help combat future pandemics.

As of July 2021, the first eight capacities were selected for support as part of the first stage of the program (PLP1) (see the [SciLifeLab webpage](https://www.scilifelab.se/pandemic-response/pandemic-laboratory-preparedness/) for more information on the selection process). These capacities in PLP1 are focussed on: Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) capacity, biobanking and clinical sample handling, environmental detection of pathogens, immunomonitoring, serology, and sequencing. Refer to the PLP1 section below to find out more about these projects.

A new **laboratory preparedness expression of interest (EoI) call** to create a nationally significant infrastructure capability was launched in Spring 2022. These proposals were to be integrated with real-world testing and proof of concept. The projects should be possible to establish within a relatively short timeframe, such as a single year. More background information on this second call (PLP2) is available on the [SciLifeLab webpage](https://www.scilifelab.se/capabilities/pandemic-laboratory-preparedness/pandemic-response/calls/call-for-new-pandemic-laboratory-preparedness-capabilities-plp-2/). Please see the below section on PLP2 to find out more about the capabilities selected from this call.

The PLP program also supports a number of Technology Development Projects (TDPs). The call for TDPs (established December 2021) was established in order to build closer associations with the clinical microbiology labs in Sweden. The TDP projects will develop services and capabilities at major clinical microbiology laboratories in Sweden. For more information about this call please refer to the [SciLifeLab webpage](https://www.scilifelab.se/news/call-for-new-pandemic-laboratory-preparedness-capabilities-plp-cm-tdp/).

Since the emergence of Omicron (a new SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VoC)) in December 2021, the PLP program and SciLifeLab have been putting further resources into research on Omicron. Research on the Omicron variant is already underway in the different PLP projects.

## Pillars of the PLP program

The Pandemic Laboratory Prepardness program is built on **four pillars**:

* *National infrastructure*
* *Biobanks and diagnostics*
* *National research program*
* *The COVID-19 & Pandemic Preparedness Data Portal*

As you may note, this Portal (formerly the Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal)forms one of four pillars of PLP program. Our scope is expanding to include resources related to pandemic preparedness and infectious diseases that could be the cause of future pandemics. However, as the current pandemic is still ongoing, *COVID-19* will remain a major focus.

## The PLP network

The PLP program aims to build a national network of laboratory capabilities (the PLP network). Capabilities are funded in different calls. In this section, we list the capabilities funded in each call and provide links to their webpages.

### PLP1 capabilities

The following eight PLP capabilites are part of The Pandemic Laboratory Preparedness Program 1 (PLP1)

### PLP2 capabilities

The following PLP capabilites are part of The Pandemic Laboratory Preparedness Program 2 (PLP2). Links to these projects will be made available as soon as possible.
