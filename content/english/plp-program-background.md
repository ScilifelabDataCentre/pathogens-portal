The Science for Life Laboratory (SciLifeLab) research community has been actively engaged in national and international COVID-19 research efforts sice early 2020. The ability to access established SciLifeLab infrastructure and expertise within that research community undoubtedly expedited studies on COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 at the molecular, cellular, patient, population, and environmental levels.

As part of their efforts to tackle the pandemic, SciLifeLab was quick to establish programs to support research efforts. The first was the [The SciLifeLab/KAW National COVID-19 Research Program](https://www.scilifelab.se/pandemic-response/covid-19-research-program/), which was established in April 2020 and co-funded by the [Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation (KAW)](https://kaw.wallenberg.org/stiftelsens-satsningar-pa-atgarder-mot-coronaviruset). More recently, SciLifeLab was commissioned to establish a program focussed on pandemic preparedness. Here, we provide background and relevant links related to the resultant research program; the Pandemic Laboratory Preparedness (PLP) program.

## Progress to date

In December 2020, the Swedish government [comissioned SciLifeLab to build capacity for future pandemics](https://www.regeringen.se/rattsliga-dokument/proposition/2020/12/forskning-frihet-framtid--kunskap-och-innovation-for-sverige/). The assignment broadly involved supporting **research related to infectious diseases** (e.g. in diagnostics, analysis of infection, immunity, and the development of resistance to therapies in pathogens), and **building competence** and **developing technologies** related to pandemic research (e.g. in sequencing, genetic analysis, immunology, and big data). The services, tools, and resources (termed 'capabilities') established through the PLP program are intended to assist and complement those established elsewhere in society (e.g. authorities, municipalities, and regions) to tackle future pandemics. As such, the PLP program works in close consultation with governmental agencies, e.g. [Swedish Public Health Agency (FoHM)](www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se).

In February 2021, the PLP program sent out a national open call for letters of intent to develop capabilities (i.e. tools/resources/services) that could be used to detect and monitor COVID-19, and/or to help combat future pandemics.

As of July 2021, the first eight capabilities were selected for support as part of the first stage of the program (PLP1) ([further information on the selection process is available on the main SciLifeLab.se website](https://www.scilifelab.se/pandemic-response/pandemic-laboratory-preparedness/)). The capabilities in PLP1 were focussed on: biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) capacity, biobanking and clinical sample handling, environmental detection of pathogens, immunomonitoring, serology, and sequencing. Refer to the [PLP1 section](/plp-program-background/#plp1-capabilities) below to find out more about these capabilities.

A **laboratory preparedness expression of interest (EoI) call** was launched as the second call of the PLP program in spring 2022. The aim was to create a nationally significant infrastructure capability. Any proposals were expected to integrate real-world testing and proof-of-concepts. The resultant projects were expected to be able begin within a year. More background information on this second call (PLP2) is available on the [SciLifeLab website](https://www.scilifelab.se/capabilities/pandemic-laboratory-preparedness/pandemic-response/calls/call-for-new-pandemic-laboratory-preparedness-capabilities-plp-2/). Please see the [below section on PLP2](/plp-program-background/#plp2-capabilities) to find out more about the capabilities selected from this call.

The PLP program also supports a number of Technology Development Projects (TDPs). The call for TDPs (which was in December 2021) was established in order to build closer associations between clinical microbiology laboratories in Sweden. The projects aimed to develop services and capabilities at major clinical microbiology laboratories in Sweden. For more information about this call please refer to the [SciLifeLab website](https://www.scilifelab.se/news/call-for-new-pandemic-laboratory-preparedness-capabilities-plp-cm-tdp/). Please see the [below TDP section](/plp-program-background/#plp-tdps) for more information about the TDPs resulting from this call.

In December 2021, a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (Omicron) emerged. At the time, the PLP program and wider SciLifeLab community rapidly put further resources into research on the novel variant.

## Pillars of the PLP program

The PLP program is built on **four pillars**:

- _National infrastructure_
- _Biobanks and diagnostics_
- _National research program_
- _The Swedish Pathogens Portal_

This portal (formerly the Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal) forms one of four pillars of PLP program. The scope of the portal includes pandemic preparedness topics, including antibiotic resistance and infectious disease.

## The PLP network

The PLP program aims to build a national network of laboratory capabilities (the PLP network). Capabilities are funded in different calls (see above for basic information on previous calls). In this section, we list the capabilities funded in each call and provide links to further information on each capability.

All PLP capabilities are also linked on our [Pandemic Preparedness Resources page](/resources/).
