In line with the principles of _FAIR_ and _Open Science_, we encourage the reuse of material made available on the Swedish Pathogens Portal. On this page, you will find information about how to cite the portal in the event that you reuse the content. Please note that the information on the portal is updated continuously, therefore it is important to refer to specific versions (or to provide access dates) within citations.

## Research community

In this section, you'll find instructions on how to cite the portal website, or underlying code, in reearch publications.

### Citing website content

##### Research Resource Identifier of Swedish Pathogens Portal

The Resource Identification Portal was created in support of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rrids.org/">Resource Identification Initiative</a>. It aims to promote the identification, discovery, and reuse of research resources. Research Resource Identifiers (**RRIDs**) are persistent and unique identifiers for referencing a research resource.

The RRID for the Swedish Pathogens Portal is **SCR_024866**.

By citing the portal using the RRID, you will facilitate further reuse of the portal, enable us to track reuse of the portal, and allow others to easily find the _Summary Report_ for usage the Swedish Pathogens Portal.

##### APA format

**In-text citation**: The data was made available on the Swedish Pathogens Portal (RRID:SCR\*024866)(_insert year_)

**Reference list** SciLifeLab Data Centre (2024). Swedish Pathogens Portal, version (_insert version_) from <https://pathogens.se>, RRID:SCR_024866.

You will find the version of the Portal at the bottom of the footer on any page, or on our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/pathogens-portal">Github repository</a>.

If you are aiming to cite particular pages of the portal in particular (e.g. the Data Highlights), you may find that an author is mentioned and a date is given. In this case, you should include the appropriate date and author instead, but must still include the RRID.

### Citing underlying code

From the start, the portal has been operated by the <a target="_blank" href="https://scilifelab.se/data">SciLifeLab Data Centre</a> and partners. Many individuals from the wider community have also contributed to the code over time. All of the source code used on the website is available on GitHub. The code used to produce the website is available in our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/pathogens-portal">pathogens-portal repository</a>, and all code used for visualisations are in our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/pathogens-portal-visualisations">visualisations repository</a>. All of the code that we have produced is available for reuse under an MIT licence.
