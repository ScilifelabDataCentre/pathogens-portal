Protein analysis can be conducted using different types of methodologies and across different types of samples. A brief description of technologies using affinity proteomics or mass spectrometry is listed below:

#### Affinity-based protein detection

* Multiplexed analysis of proteins in body fluids at [Plasma Profiling](https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/plasma-profiling/)

* Array-based analysis of antibodies and autoantibody repertoires at [Autoimmunity Profiling](https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/autoimmunity-profiling/)

* Proximity-based assays for high-specificity protein analyses at [Proximity Assay](https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/pla-proteomics)

* Single cell and multi-target analysis in blood at [Mass Cytometry](https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/mass-cytometry-2/)

* Immunofluorescence analysis of cellular proteins at [Cell Profiling](https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/cell-profiling/)

#### Mass spectrometry-based protein detection

* Using chemistry for functional proteomics at [Chemical Proteomics](https://bioms.se/technologies/chemical-proteomics/) and [SciLifeLab Chemical Proteomics](https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/chemical-proteomics/)

* Post-translational modifications such as glycans and glycolipids at [Glycomics](https://bioms.se/technologies/glycomics/)

* Post-translational glycan sites on proteins at [Glycoproteomics](https://bioms.se/technologies/glycoproteomics/)

* Studying protein structures and interactions at [Protein Structure Analysis](https://bioms.se/technologies/hdx/)

* Studying genes and gene products found by proteomics at [Proteogenomics](https://bioms.se/technologies/proteogenomics/) and [SciLifeLab Proteogenomics](https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/proteogenomics/)

* Screening of natural peptides at [Quantitative Clinical Peptidomics](https://bioms.se/technologies/diagnostic-proteomics-peptidomics/)

* Screening of selected proteins in tissue or cells at [Targeted Proteomics](https://bioms.se/technologies/targeted-mass-spectrometry/)
