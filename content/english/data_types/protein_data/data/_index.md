## Published Data

#### General useful data sources

* The [Human Protein Atlas (HPA)](https://www.proteinatlas.org)
  provides open access to protein expression data across human organs,
  tissues and cells. This protein resource is organized into focused
  sections for tissue expression, subcellular expression, proteins in
  the brain or in blood, proteins related to pathology and metabolic
  pathways. A special page of HPA has been dedicated to [human proteins and
  SARS-CoV-2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/sars-cov-2).

#### Data available on the European COVID-19 Data Portal

* [Sequence, functional and classification data on SARS-CoV-2 and host proteins](https://www.covid19dataportal.org/proteins?db=uniprot-covid19)
