## Published Data

#### General useful data sources

* The [Human Protein Atlas (HPA)](https://www.proteinatlas.org)
  provides open access to protein expression data across human organs,
  tissues and cells. This protein resource is organized into focused
  sections for tissue expression, subcellular expression, proteins in
  the brain or in blood, proteins related to pathology and metabolic
  pathways. A special page of HPA has been dedicated to [human proteins and
  SARS-CoV-2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/sars-cov-2).

* [PRIDE PRoteomics IDEntifications (PRIDE) Archive database](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/) - centralized, standards compliant, public data repository for mass spectrometry proteomics data, including protein and peptide identifications and the corresponding expression values, post-translational modifications and supporting mass spectra evidence (both as raw data and peak list files). PRIDE is a core member in the ProteomeXchange (PX) consortium, which provides a standardised way for submitting mass spectrometry based proteomics data to public-domain repositories. Datasets are submitted to ProteomeXchange via PRIDE and are handled by expert bio-curators. All PRIDE public datasets can also be searched in ProteomeCentral, the portal for all ProteomeXchange datasets.

* [PROTEOMEEXCHANGE Consortium](http://www.proteomexchange.org/) - globally coordinated standard data submission and dissemination pipelines involving the main proteomics repositories.

* [MassIVE](https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/massive.jsp) - a community resource developed by the NIH-funded Center for Computational Mass Spectrometry to promote the global, free exchange of mass spectrometry data. MassIVE datasets can be assigned ProteomeXchange accessions to satisfy publication requirements.

#### Data available on the European COVID-19 Data Portal
