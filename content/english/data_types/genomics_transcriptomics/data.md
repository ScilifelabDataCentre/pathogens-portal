## Published Data

Genomics and transcriptomics refers to the study of DNA and RNA, typically using High-throughput sequencing.
A number of different genomic and transcriptomic methods can be used to research the COVID-19 pandemic.

For example, relevant methodologies could include:

* Virus detection in patient samples, using RT-PCR
* Sequencing of the viral genome in patient samples
* Host genome analysis, to identify genetic risk factors for a severe disease
* Direct RNA sequencing of the viral genome, to detect RNA modifications
* Transcriptomic analysis of RNA in the host, to determine host response during infection
* and many more...

Published raw and assembled sequences related to the COVID-19 outbreak, including outbreak isolates and records relating to coronavirus biology:
