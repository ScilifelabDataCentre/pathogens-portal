## Small molecule screening and drug repurposing research

### Chemical Biology Consortium Sweden (CBCS)

From the [Compound Center at the facility for Chemical Biology (CBCS)](http://www.cbcs.se/) you may access ~200 000 compounds.
The collection comprises sets that are chemical diverse and suitable for target based or cell based phenotypic screens identifying new compounds modelling a pathway or a target.
Also known drugs and tool compounds are available for screening and for drug repurposing projects.

* 1200 FDA approved drugs from Prestwick
* 5600 known drugs and clinical candidates from SPECS mirroring the [Broad Institute drug repurposing hub](https://clue.io/repurposing)

The compounds are available in screening volumes (nL) of 10 mM DMSO stock solutions in assay ready plates.
Some reference compounds are available in larger volumes for assay development purpose.
CBCS also provides support for assay development & screening and hit follow up.

For more information please [visit our homepage](http://www.cbcs.se/) or contact [anna-lena.gustavsson@scilifelab.se](mailto:anna-lena.gustavsson@scilifelab.se).

### Chemical Proteomics Core Facility (ChemProt)

Proteome-wide quantitative analysis in cells and lysates to deconvolute targets and determine of mechanism of action of active compounds.
Uses orthogonal MS-based and proteome-wide approaches to identify key proteins relevant the phenotype produced by a treatment of a compound or a drug molecule.
Structural binding studies for elucidation of protein binding interface when probed with ligand molecules are carried out using Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS).

You can find more information on [our website](https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/chemical-proteomics-core-facility) or contact [massimiliano.gaetani@ki.se](mailto:massimiliano.gaetani@ki.se).

### High Throughput Genome Engineering (HTGE)

CRISPR-Cas9 genetic loss- and gain-of-function screens with pooled, lentiviral guide-libraries and other high-throughput CRISPR applications.
HTGE's core service are pooled, lentiviral high throughput functional genomic screens using the CRISPR-Cas9 system in cell lines.
Pooled CRISPR-Cas9 screening enables parallel interrogation of thousands to tens of thousands of genes for involvement in biological processes of interest.
HTGE creates and provides access to verified lentiviral CRISPR guide libraries for whole genome or targeted loss- and gain of function studies (CRISPR knock-out, CRISPR inhibition, CRISPR activation).
HTGE also offers generation of stable Cas9-expressing lines in users’ cells of interest.

For more information on our services, please refer to [our webpage](https://www.scilifelab.se/HTGE) or contact [bernhard.schmierer@scilifelab.se](mailto:bernhard.schmierer@scilifelab.se).

### Genome Engineering Zebrafishes (GEZ)

The Zebrafish facility provides an infrastructure and individually tailored support for projects utilizing this popular model system for vertebrate development and disease.
Zebrafish embryos are transparent and develop outside the mother’s body, which greatly facilitates manipulation and imaging of biological processes.
The facility allows researchers to take advantage of the unique features of the zebrafish model system, and provides initial advice on feasibility and experimental design as well as running support over the course of the project.

## Development of new therapeutics for SARS-Cov2

### SciLifeLab Drug Discovery & Development Platform (DDD)

Following screening- or drug repurposing efforts described above, the [SciLifeLab Drug Discovery and Development platform (DDD)](https://www.scilifelab.se/platforms/ddd) offers integrated drug discovery efforts to the Swedish academic research community.

DDD offers industry standard infrastructure, expertise, and strategic support to help progress projects towards a preclinical proof-of-concept.
The drug leads can be either a small molecule drug or a human antibody therapeutic.

The DDD platform directors Per Arvidsson and Kristian Sandberg are glad to meet and discuss your ideas!
Please contact us at [dddprojectproposal@scilifelab.se](mailto:dddprojectproposal@scilifelab.se).
