The Swedish Research Council has set up a single national entry point,
[RegisterResearch.se](http://registerresearch.se), which provides information
and support on register-based research in Sweden.
Rich metadata descriptions from public authority register, national quality
registers and biobank sample collections can be found via the digital
infrastructure and metadata platform RUT
([Register Utiliser Tool](https://www.registerforskning.se/en/registers-in-sweden/easier-to-find-register-data-with-the-register-utiliser-tool/)).
RUT currently includes metadata with COVID-19 variables from the
National Quality Register for intensive care (SIR).
Addition of COVID-19 variables to registers is currently taking place.
Inclusion of new registers to RUT is ongoing.

Most of the metadata and concepts in RUT are in Swedish.
Semantic mapping to international ontologies and terminologies has been
carried out in some registers connected to RUT and is ongoing in other
registers.
Such mapping enables machine readability and multilingualism in the
languages implemented by the ontologies or terminologies.
