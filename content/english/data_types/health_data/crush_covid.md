    For each postal code which is found within the Uppsala l√§n, the dataset contains weekly data on cases per capita, tests per capita and % positivity. Our estimates are calculated based on the adult population of each postal code (individuals 15 years of age and older). For reference, both the total population and the adult population are included.
