If you have a dataset that you would like to share but you are not sure how to do it or if you have a data management question for your project on COVID-19, [the team behind the Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal](/about/) will be happy to help you find a good solution. Fill out the form below or send us an email: [datacentre@scilifelab.se](mailto:datacentre@scilifelab.se).

The Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal keeps track of available datasets, ongoing research projects, upcoming funding opportunities, publications, and preprints by researchers and organisations in Sweden relevant for research into COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2. We welcome suggestions for new items that could be added to the portal by the community. Simply fill out the form below, and we will consider adding the suggested resource to the data portal. You are welcome to send links to your own datasets, projects, publications, etc. or suggest items published by others.
