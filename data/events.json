In 2019, 1.3 million people are estimated to have died as a result of infections caused by resistant bacteria. Yet, no new class of antibiotics has reached healthcare in nearly four decades. Today, we have reached the point where new drugs alone are no longer sufficient and the problem is so complex that collaboration is absolutely necessary.<br><br>NorDoc Summer School 2023 will focus on how we can handle one of the greatest challenges of our time. We will meet in Uppsala and Stockholm, the intersection of Swedish life science, to learn from and about the many interdisciplinary initiatives that have their hub here, several with branches across the world."

            "description": "The aim is to establish proof-of-concept for life science research with expressed (pre-)clinical relevance. This will be achieved by forming a closed loop from biomedical research question (initiated by pre-clinical researchers) to returning actionable biological results, in terms of mechanisms and potential biomarkers and targets.<br><br>In this open hearing we would like to identify preclinical and clinical research questions where samples and data are available for proof of concept for a combined metabolomics/proteomics/data analysis study. We will coordinate data deliveries from platforms to data storage via inferential analysis and extraction of biomarkers and mechanisms of interest go from compute and back to the biomedical researcher (question owner)."
