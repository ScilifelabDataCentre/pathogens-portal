The most affected was the old segment of the population, where thousands died in hospitals and in elderly care homes. Different strategies were implemented to protect the population; from lockdown in Wuhan to social distancing in Stockholm. The aim of the WISER (Wuhan Interaction with Stockholm Evidence-based Research) project is to analyze health perspectives of the old population during the COVID-19 epidemic. We will analyze public health interventions on disease spreading in the old population using a Bayesian inference framework. In addition, we will identify COVID-19 risk factors in elderly living in care homes and in geriatric patients admitted to hospital. What risk factors identify vulnerable individuals in need of more advanced care? Moreover, we will follow up geriatric patients and analyze their long-term health consequences after COVID-19 infection. As we partly use selected samples in the analyses, we will also develop methods to account for sampling bias.The research team from China and Sweden brings together experts in infectious disease epidemiology, biostatistics, gerontologists knowledgeable on frailty, as well as clinical geriatricians important for collecting clinical data. The project covers three years, with shared responsibility for the aims. Together, we will move the forefront in COVID-19 epidemiology of the most affected old individuals.",

    "project_description": "The role of mucosal immunity in COVID-19 has received little attention, despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 enters the body through the respiratory and possibly, oro-gastrointestinal mucosa. This collaborative project between China and Sweden project aims to study and understand the mucosal immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and establish novel prophylactics and therapeutics delivered at mucosal surfaces for treatment of COVID-19. We will study the dynamic of the mucosal immune response in humans and animal infected with SARS-CoV-2 as well as evaluate the mucosal immune response following oral and intranasal immunization with inactivated whole virus and adenovirus-vectored vaccine in animal models. We will also develop antivirals and anti-inflammatory drugs for mucosal delivery and test their antiviral activity in enteroid and animal models. The Chinese team has a rich collection of coronavirus strains, unique infection animal models, and nanotechnology expertise which effectively support vaccine, antibody, and drug evaluation. The Swedish team has a unique enteroid model to test the drugs, antibody engineering expertise and an efficient screening technology system for discovery of inflammation regulators and antivirals. Our work will lead to a better understanding of the antiviral and anti-inflammatory mechanisms of the vaccine and drugs thus contributing to counteract the current as well as possible future pandemics caused by related animal coronaviruses.",

Therefore, large investments in both pulse oximetry and oxygen systems have been promised by international donors for low-respurce settings. With 800,000 annual paediatric pneumonia deaths, working in equitable partnerships to ensure that the rapid investment and scale-up is context-appropriate and sustainable is therefore crucial to secure the potential of future benefits of newly installed oxygen systems for child survival.The aim of the VR Networks Links Grant is to promote long term and sustainable health system strengthening in the area of paediatric pneumonia in Nigeria through mutual capacity building beween University College Hospital Ibadan and Karolinska Institutet. We will do this through joint supervision of a Nigerian PhD student in clinical community paediatric pneumonia research; dissemination workshops using the “Every Breath Counts Coalition” platform; strategic planning for wider scale-up and sustainability; jointly publishing academic papers.The network will focus around the primary research question: What is the impact of pulse oximetry at primary and secondary health facilities and improved oxygen at secondary health facilities on case-fatality rates (CFR) for clinical pneumonia cases in children under-5 in Lagos state, Nigeria?",
