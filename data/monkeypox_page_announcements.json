This webinar will be part of a series providing information about access calls and application modalities, and to answer any questions. The event will take place 12th July 2022 10am - 11:30am CEST. [Registration](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdvfwSXuvemzFRVU4X-_2p1m-v7xWHlXs8zuJ2kRaoZIGaErA/viewform) is required. Questions should be submitted to contact@isidore-project.eu."

One workflow (Illumina metatranscriptomic PE) deals with variant analysis from metatranscriptomic data. The other workflow (Report generation) can be used to generate the final variant analysis reports/plots. The workflows, and instructions on how to use them, [are found here](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/mpxv/). More workflows will be added here over time"

    "text": "Since 13 May 2022, 92 laboratory confirmed cases of monkeypox have been reported to the WHO from Member States that are not endemic for monkeypox virus. With epidemiological investigations ongoing we are repurposing the pipelines built during the COVID-19 pandemic to demonstrate preparedness for other infectious disease outbreaks. Therefore we are seeking your help in connecting us to laboratories or individuals who are active in sequencing monkeypox virus. We have created [a document outlining the data submission into our open databases](https://www.covid19dataportal.org/news/monkeypox-viral-data-submissions?nid=2038) with a particular focus on attribution for data producers and can provide technical support to streamline the data submission process. If you are aware of ongoing sequencing efforts of monkeypox virus or would like to suggest any other data resources that should be connected please contact virus-dataflow@ebi.ac.uk."
