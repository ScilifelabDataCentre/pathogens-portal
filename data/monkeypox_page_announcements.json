    "text": "Since 13 May 2022, 92 laboratory confirmed cases of monkeypox have been reported to the WHO from Member States that are not endemic for monkeypox virus. With epidemiological investigations ongoing we are repurposing the pipelines built during the COVID-19 pandemic to demonstrate preparedness for other infectious disease outbreaks. Therefore we are seeking your help in connecting us to laboratories or individuals who are active in sequencing monkeypox virus. We have created [a document outlining the data submission into our open databases](https://www.covid19dataportal.org/news/monkeypox-viral-data-submissions?nid=2038) with a particular focus on attribution for data producers and can provide technical support to streamline the data submission process. If you are aware of ongoing sequencing efforts of monkeypox virus or would like to suggest any other data resources that should be connected please contact virus-dataflow@ebi.ac.uk."
