We report 22 APS-1 patients from 21 kindreds in seven countries, aged between 8 and 48 yr and infected with SARS-CoV-2 since February 2020. The 21 patients tested had auto-Abs neutralizing IFN-\u03b1 subtypes and/or IFN-\u03c9; one had anti-IFN-\u03b2 and another anti-IFN-\u03b5, but none had anti-IFN-\u03ba. Strikingly, 19 patients (86%) were hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia, including 15 (68%) admitted to an intensive care unit, 11 (50%) who required mechanical ventilation, and four (18%) who died.

People around the world are still struggling to overcome the problems associated with this pandemic. Of all the available methods, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been widely practiced for the pandemic detection even though several diagnostic tools are available having varying accuracy and sensitivity. The method offers many advantages making it a life-saving tool, but the method has the limitation of transporting to the nearest pathology lab, thus limiting its application in resource limited settings. This has a risen a crucial need for point-of-care devices for on-site detection. In this venture, biosensors have been used, since they can be applied immediately at the point-of-care.

This new condition is heterogenous but resembles Kawasaki disease (KD), a well-known but poorly understood and clinically heterogenous pediatric inflammatory condition for which weak associations have been found with a myriad of viral illnesses. Epidemiological data clearly indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is the trigger for MIS-C, which typically occurs about 1 mo after infection. These findings support the hypothesis of viral triggers for the various forms of classic KD. We further suggest that rare inborn errors of immunity (IEIs) altering the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 may underlie the pathogenesis of MIS-C in some children.

million cases and 333,212 deaths, COVID-19 (or SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread. General symptoms of this disease are similar to that of many other viral respiratory diseases, including fever, cough, dyspnea, and fatigue, with a chance of progression to more severe complications. However, the virus does not affect all people equally, and cases with comorbidities such as malignancies, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and kidney diseases are at higher risk of developing severe events, including requiring intensive ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death. Patients with cancer are more likely to be infected with COVID-19, which is possibly due to their immunological dysfunction or frequent clinic visits. Also, there is a higher chance that these patients experience severe events because of the medication they receive.

To date, our knowledge about its effect on the human host remains limited. It is well known that host genetic factors account for the individual differences in the susceptibility to infectious diseases. The genetic susceptibility factors to COVID-19 and its severity are associated with several unanswered questions. However, the experience gained from an earlier strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1, which shows 78% genetic similarity to SARS-CoV-2 and uses the same receptor to bind to host cells, could provide some clues. It, therefore, seems possible to assemble new evidence in order to solve a potential genetic predisposition puzzle for COVID-19.

Regression models adjusted for potential confounders were used to examine mean score differences (MSD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) between compliance with the recommendations and HRQL.\n\nIn total, 134 individuals participated in the study. At 5 weeks, a reduction in role function was seen for individuals who fully (MSD -8, 95% CI: -16 to 0) and to a large extent (MSD -19, 95% CI: -26 to -12) complied with the recommendations. Less fatigue (MSD 9, 95% CI: 3-15) was also detected for this group. Being female, elderly, having comorbidities, living in a region with higher COVID-19 incidence, living in a villa, and being considered as an at-risk person were related to changes in role function. At 13 weeks, reductions in role function continued for those who fully complied with the recommendations (MSD -10, 95% CI: -19 to -1), but the risk variables were of less importance. Improvements in fatigue were no longer detected. Global quality of life, emotional function, or insomnia remained stable over time.\n\nThis study indicates that individuals who undergone surgery for esophageal cancer and fully or to a large extent complied with the recommendations experienced reductions in role function, but not in global quality of life or emotional function, during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "doi": "10.1080/0284186X.2021.1921260", "pmid": "33974501", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Health": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-05-17T18:50:05.413Z", "modified": "2021-05-17T18:50:05.423Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "3a2fb90fbc5c49049f3760352f9c6421", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/3a2fb90fbc5c49049f3760352f9c6421.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/3a2fb90fbc5c49049f3760352f9c6421"}}, "title": "Institutional and behaviour-change interventions to support COVID-19 public health measures: a review by the Lancet Commission Task Force on public health measures to suppress the pandemic.", "authors": [{"family": "Lee", "given": "Jong-Koo", "initials": "JK"}, {"family": "Bullen", "given": "Chris", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Ben Amor", "given": "Yanis", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Bush", "given": "Simon R", "initials": "SR"}, {"family": "Colombo", "given": "Francesca", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Gaviria", "given": "Alejandro", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Karim", "given": "Salim S Abdool", "initials": "SSA"}, {"family": "Kim", "given": "Booyuel", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Lavis", "given": "John N", "initials": "JN"}, {"family": "Lazarus", "given": "Jeffrey V", "initials": "JV"}, {"family": "Lo", "given": "Yi-Chun", "initials": "YC"}, {"family": "Michie", "given": "Susan F", "initials": "SF"}, {"family": "Norheim", "given": "Ole F", "initials": "OF"}, {"family": "Oh", "given": "Juhwan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Reddy", "given": "Kolli Srinath", "initials": "KS"}, {"family": "Rostila", "given": "Mikael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "S\u00e1enz", "given": "Roc\u00edo", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Smith", "given": "Liam D G", "initials": "LDG"}, {"family": "Thwaites", "given": "John W", "initials": "JW"}, {"family": "Were", "given": "Miriam K", "initials": "MK"}, {"family": "Xue", "given": "Lan", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "(The Lancet COVID-19 Commission Task Force for Public Health Measures to Suppress the Pandemic)", "given": "", "initials": ""}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-05-11", "journal": {"title": "Int Health", "issn": "1876-3405", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "The Lancet COVID-19 Commission Task Force for Public Health Measures to Suppress the Pandemic was launched to identify critical points for consideration by governments on public health interventions to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The primary aim of this study was to investigate factors contributing to physician-related variability in end-of-life decision-making.\n\nThis is a qualitative sub-study of a previously conducted study. In-depth thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with 19 critical care specialists from five different Swedish intensive care units was performed. Interviews took place between February 1, 2017, and May 31, 2017.\n\nFactors influencing physician-related variability consisted of different assessment of patient preferences, as well as intensivists' personality and values. Personality was expressed mainly through pace and determination in the decision-making process. Personal prejudices appeared in decisions, but few respondents had personally witnessed this. Avoidance of criticism and conflicts as well as individual strategies for emotional coping were other factors that influenced physician-related variability. Many respondents feared criticism for making their assessments, and the challenging nature of end-of-life decision-making lead to avoidance as well as emotional stress.\n\nVariability in end-of-life decision-making is an important topic that needs further investigation.

In this scoping review we aimed to systematically collect the evidence on 1) the impact of common infections such as influenza, pneumonia and varicella zoster on frailty development, and 2) the role played by frailty in the response to immunization of older adults. Findings are discussed under a unifying framework to identify knowledge gaps and outline their clinical and public health implications to foster a healthier aging. Twenty-nine studies (113,863 participants) selected to answer the first question provided a moderately strong evidence of an association between infections and physical as well as cognitive decline - two essential dimensions of frailty. Thirteen studies (34,520 participants) investigating the second aim, showed that frailty was associated with an impaired immune response in older ages, likely due to immunosenescence. However, the paucity of studies, the absence of tools to predict vaccine efficacy, and the lack of studies investigating the efficacy of newer vaccines in presence of frailty, strongly limit the formulation of more personalized immunization strategies for older adults. The current evidence suggests that infections and frailty repeatedly cross each other pathophysiological paths and accelerate the aging process in a vicious circle. Such evidence opens to several considerations. First, the prevention of both conditions pass through a life course approach, which includes several individual and societal aspects. Second, the maintenance of a well-functioning immune system may be accomplished by preventing frailty, and vice versa. Third, increasing the adherence to immunization may delay the onset of frailty and maintain the immune system homeostasis, beyond preventing infections.", "doi": "10.1016/j.arr.2021.101351", "pmid": "33971332", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S1568-1637(21)00098-2"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-05-17T19:01:01.504Z", "modified": "2021-05-17T19:01:09.752Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "cd5dcd1a8c0947f2aa56016df442cd57", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/cd5dcd1a8c0947f2aa56016df442cd57.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/cd5dcd1a8c0947f2aa56016df442cd57"}}, "title": "How mobility restrictions policy and atmospheric conditions impacted air quality in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo during the COVID-19 outbreak.", "authors": [{"family": "Rudke", "given": "A P", "initials": "AP"}, {"family": "Martins", "given": "J A", "initials": "JA"}, {"family": "de Almeida", "given": "D S", "initials": "DS"}, {"family": "Martins", "given": "L D", "initials": "LD"}, {"family": "Beal", "given": "A", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Hallak", "given": "R", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Freitas", "given": "E D", "initials": "ED"}, {"family": "Andrade", "given": "M F", "initials": "MF"}, {"family": "Foroutan", "given": "H", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Baek", "given": "B H", "initials": "BH"}, {"family": "de A Albuquerque", "given": "T T", "initials": "TT"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-05-07", "journal": {"title": "Environ Res", "issn": "1096-0953", "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": "111255", "issn-l": "0013-9351"}, "abstract": "Mobility restrictions are among actions to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and have been pointed as reasons for improving air quality, especially in large cities. However, it is crucial to assess the impact of atmospheric conditions on air quality and air pollutant dispersion in the face of the potential variability of all sources. In this study, the impact of mobility restrictions on the air quality was analyzed for the most populous Brazilian State, S\u00e3o Paulo, severely impacted by COVID-19. Ground-based air quality data (PM 10, PM2.5, CO, SO2, NOx, NO2, NO, and O3) were used from 50 automatic air quality monitoring stations to evaluate the changes in concentrations before (January 01 - March 25) and during the partial quarantine (March 16 - June 30). Rainfall, fires, and daily cell phone mobility data were also used as supplementary information to the analyses. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess the heterogeneity of the air quality data during and before mobility restrictions. In general, the results demonstrated no substantial improvements in air quality for most of the pollutants when comparing before and during restrictions periods. Besides, when the analyzed period of 2020 is compared with the year 2019, there is no significant air quality improvement in the S\u00e3o Paulo State. However, special attention should be given to the Metropolitan Area of S\u00e3o Paulo (MASP), due to the vast population residing in this area and exposed to air pollution. The region reached an average decrease of 29% in CO, 28% in NOx, 40% in NO, 19% in SO2, 15% in PM2.5, and 8% in PM10 concentrations during the mobility restrictions period compared to the same period in 2019. The only pollutant that showed an increase in concentration was ozone, with a 20% increase compared to 2019 during the mobility restrictions period. Before the mobility restrictions period, the region reached an average decrease of 30% in CO, 39% in NOx, 63% in NO, 12% in SO2, 23% in PM2.5, 18% in PM10, and 16% in O3 concentrations when compared to the same period in 2019. On the other hand, Cubat\u00e3o, a highly industrialized area, showed statistically significant increases above 20% for most monitored pollutants in both periods of 2020 compared to 2019. This study reinforces that the main driving force of pollutant concentration variability is the dynamics of the atmosphere at its various time scales. An abnormal rainy season, with above average rainfall before the restrictions and below average after it, generated a scenario in which the probable significant reductions in emissions did not substantially affect the concentration of pollutants.", "doi": "10.1016/j.envres.2021.111255", "pmid": "33971134", "labels": {"Category: Other": null, "Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0013-9351(21)00549-1"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-05-17T19:01:41.083Z", "modified": "2021-05-17T19:01:41.093Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "db3b2d224a54435bad4d993f3797ac03", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/db3b2d224a54435bad4d993f3797ac03.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/db3b2d224a54435bad4d993f3797ac03"}}, "title": "International transfers of personal data for health research following Schrems II: a problem in need of a solution.", "authors": [{"family": "Hallinan", "given": "Dara", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Bernier", "given": "Alexander", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Cambon-Thomsen", "given": "Anne", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Crawley", "given": "Francis P", "initials": "FP"}, {"family": "Dimitrova", "given": "Diana", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Medeiros", "given": "Claudia Bauzer", "initials": "CB"}, {"family": "Nilsonne", "given": "Gustav", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Parker", "given": "Simon", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Pickering", "given": "Brian", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Rennes", "given": "St\u00e9phanie", "initials": "S"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-05-06", "journal": {"title": "Eur J Hum Genet", "issn": "1476-5438", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "On 16 July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued their decision in the Schrems II case concerning Facebook's transfers of personal data from the EU to the US.

While the medical community has gained insight into the epidemiology of COVID-19, important questions remain about the clinical complexities and underlying mechanisms of disease phenotypes. Severe COVID-19 most commonly involves respiratory manifestations, although other systems are also affected, and acute disease is often followed by protracted complications. Such complex manifestations suggest that SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates the host response, triggering wide-ranging immuno-inflammatory, thrombotic, and parenchymal derangements. We review the intricacies of COVID-19 pathophysiology, its various phenotypes, and the anti-SARS-CoV-2 host response at the humoral and cellular levels. Some similarities exist between COVID-19 and respiratory failure of other origins, but evidence for many distinctive mechanistic features indicates that COVID-19 constitutes a new disease entity, with emerging data suggesting involvement of an endotheliopathy-centred pathophysiology.

An early quarantine postpones but does not alter the course of the pandemic at a cost that increases in the duration and the extent of the quarantine. For quarantines at later stages of the pandemic there is a trade-off between lowering the peak level of infectious people on the one hand and minimizing fatalities and economic losses on the other hand. A longer quarantine dampens the peak level of infectious people and also reduces the total number of infected persons but increases economic losses. Both the peak level of infectious individuals and the total share of the population that will have been infected are U-shaped in relation to the share of the population in quarantine, while economic costs increase in this share.

We investigated skin microvascular reactivity on two separate days during hospitalization (study day 1 and 2) and at least three months after disease onset (study day 3). Twelve controls with no confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection during 2020 were also examined.

with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. A urinary proteomic biomarker (COV50) developed by capillary-electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) technology, comprising 50 sequenced peptides and identifying the parental proteins, was evaluated in 228 patients (derivation cohort) with replication in 99 patients (validation cohort). Death and progression along the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Progression Scale were assessed up to 21 days after the initial PCR test. Statistical methods included logistic regression, receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis and comparison of the area under the curve (AUC).\n\nin the derivation cohort, 23 patients died, and 48 developed worse WHO scores. The odds ratios (OR) for death per 1 standard deviation (SD) increment in COV50 were 3\u00b752 (95% CI, 2\u00b702-6\u00b713, p <0\u00b70001) unadjusted and 2\u00b773 (1\u00b725-5\u00b795, p = 0\u00b7012) adjusted for sex, age, baseline WHO score, body mass index (BMI) and comorbidities.

Currently, no effective vaccines are available for pathogens with a highly variable antigenic load, such as the Human Immunodeficiency Virus or to induce cellular T cell immunity in the fight against cancer. The recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has reinforced the relevance of designing smart therapeutic vaccine modalities to ensure public health. Indeed, academic and private companies have ongoing joint efforts to develop novel vaccine prototypes for this virus. Many pathogens are covered by a dense glycan-coat, which form an attractive target for vaccine development. Moreover, many tumor types are characterized by altered glycosylation profiles that are known as 'tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens' (TACA). Unfortunately, glycans do not provoke a vigorous immune response and generally serve as T cell-independent antigens, not eliciting protective IgG responses nor inducing immunological memory. A close and continuous crosstalk between glycochemists and glycoimmunologists is essential for the successful development of efficient immune modulators. It is clear that this is a key point for the discovery of novel approaches, which could significantly improve our understanding of the immune system.

agricultural food products industry in Bangladesh depends on utilizing antimicrobials indiscriminately as growth promoters and for controlling infectious diseases. Thus, there is always a risk of antimicrobial agent accumulation in food sources that originate from agricultural production.\n\nIn the present study, we collected data from published articles between January, 2013 and December, 2019 on antimicrobial residues in human food sources such as meat, milk, eggs, and fishes.\n\nLiver contained the highest percentage of antimicrobial residues (74%; 95% CI: 59.66-85.37) against the invitro enteric pathogen Escherichia coli in layer chickens. Similar results were demonstrated in liver (68%; 95% CI: 53.30-80.48) and kidney (66%, 95% CI: 51.23-78.79) of layer chickens against Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis. Amongst all antibiotics, the highest concentrations of ciprofloxacin were detected in kidney (48.57%; 95% CI: 31.38-66.01), followed by liver (47.56; 95% CI: 40.88-54.30) of broiler chickens. Ciprofloxacin was also present in liver (46.15%; 95% CI: 33.70-58.96) of layer chickens. The percentage of ciprofloxacin in thigh and breast meat in broiler bird were 41.54% (95% CI: 34.54-48.79) and 37.95% (95% CI: 31.11-45.15) respectively. Enrofloxacin was the second most dominant antimicrobial agent and was present in the liver of both types of poultry (Broiler and Layer chickens: 41.54%; 95% CI: 29.44-54.4 and 437.33%; 95% CI: 30.99-44.01). The prevalence rates of enrofloxacin in thigh and breast meat of broiler chickens were 24.10% (95% CI: 18.28-30.73) and 20.51% (95% CI: 15.08-26.87), respectively. Tetracycline, a commonly used antibiotic in livestock, was present in the liver (49.23%; 95% CI: 36.60-61.93) of layer chickens. In case of aquaculture food products, the highest amount of amoxicillin (683.2 mg/kg) was detected in Tilapia fish (Oreochromis niloticus), followed by 584.4 mg/kg in climbing perch (Anabas testudineus) and 555.6 mg/kg in Rui fish (Labeo rohita). Among the five types of fishes, Rui fish (0.000515 mg/kg) contained the highest concentrations of chloramphenicol antibiotic residues.\n\nThe presence of antimicrobial residues in meat, milk, egg, and fish is a serious public health threat due to the potential induction of antimicrobial resistance. It can negatively impact the food supply chain, especially with the current strain that it is already facing with the current COVID-19 pandemic. The findings of the present study highlight the ongoing risk of residual antimicrobial agents in food of animal origin in Bangladesh and countries with similar practices. This can draw the attention of public health officials to propose plans to mitigate or stop this practice.", "doi": "10.1016/j.tifs.2021.01.075", "pmid": "33746363", "labels": {"Category: Biochemistry": null, "Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0924-2244(21)00083-2"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7953985"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-03-29T14:16:29.522Z", "modified": "2021-03-29T14:16:29.545Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "44a461149ac34464b639e5263b01da57", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/44a461149ac34464b639e5263b01da57.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/44a461149ac34464b639e5263b01da57"}}, "title": "Stigma, Trust, and procedural integrity: Covid-19 testing in Malawi.", "authors": [{"family": "Ferree", "given": "Karen E", "initials": "KE"}, {"family": "Harris", "given": "Adam S", "initials": "AS"}, {"family": "Dulani", "given": "Boniface", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Kao", "given": "Kristen", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Lust", "given": "Ellen", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Metheney", "given": "Erica", "initials": "E"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-05-00", "journal": {"title": "World Dev", "issn": "0305-750X", "volume": "141", "issue": null, "pages": "105351", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "An emerging consensus in public health views testing for Covid-19 as key to managing the pandemic. It is often assumed that citizens have a strong desire to know their Covid-19 status, and will therefore take advantage of testing opportunities. This may not be the case in all contexts, however, especially those where citizens perceive stigma associated with the Covid-19, have low trust in health institutions, and doubt the procedural integrity of the testing process. This article explores willingness to receive a free Covid-19 test via a vignette experiment (conjoint design) embedded in a phone survey conducted in Malawi in May 2020. The experiment varied test provider (public clinic versus international health organization), proximity to illness, and reassurance of confidentiality. We find that Malawians expect higher uptake of testing in their community when the international health organization offered the test rather than a public clinic, an effect we attribute to higher trust in the organization and/or perceptions of greater capacity to ensure procedural integrity. The confidentiality reassurance did not substantially alter beliefs about the privacy of results, but did increase doubts about the willingness of community members to get tested in a public health clinic. Our findings suggest the importance of considering the demand side of testing in addition to well-known challenges of supply.", "doi": "10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105351", "pmid": "33456104", "labels": {"Category: Public Health": null, "Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0305-750X(20)30479-4"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7803152"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-03-06T10:23:01.391Z", "modified": "2021-03-06T10:23:01.404Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "306ed55d95ef4f86be1ea42f3ed30577", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/306ed55d95ef4f86be1ea42f3ed30577.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/306ed55d95ef4f86be1ea42f3ed30577"}}, "title": "Disparities in European healthcare system approaches to maintaining continuity of medication for non-communicable diseases during the COVID-19 outbreak.", "authors": [{"family": "Kardas", "given": "Przemyslaw", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "van Boven", "given": "Job Frank Martien", "initials": "JFM"}, {"family": "Pinnock", "given": "Hilary", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Menditto", "given": "Enrica", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Wettermark", "given": "Bj\u00f6rn", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Tsiligianni", "given": "Ioanna", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "\u00c1gh", "given": "Tam\u00e1s", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "ENABLE collaborators", "given": "", "initials": ""}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-05-00", "journal": {"title": "Lancet Reg Health Eur", "issn": "2666-7762", "volume": "4", "issue": null, "pages": "100099", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.lanepe.2021.100099", "pmid": "33875981", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S2666-7762(21)00076-4"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC8046426"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-04-23T04:43:57.860Z", "modified": "2021-04-23T04:43:57.883Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "f8e8baec2aa84a5997263cd6b8c5edf3", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/f8e8baec2aa84a5997263cd6b8c5edf3.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/f8e8baec2aa84a5997263cd6b8c5edf3"}}, "title": "Fear of COVID-19 and workplace phobia among Pakistani doctors: A survey study.", "authors": [{"family": "Malik", "given": "Sadia", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Ullah", "given": "Irfan", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Irfan", "given": "Muhammad", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Ahorsu", "given": "Daniel Kwasi", "initials": "DK"}, {"family": "Lin", "given": "Chung-Ying", "initials": "CY"}, {"family": "Pakpour", "given": "Amir H", "initials": "AH"}, {"family": "Griffiths", "given": "Mark D", "initials": "MD"}, {"family": "Rehman", "given": "Ibad Ur", "initials": "IU"}, {"family": "Minhas", "given": "Rafia", "initials": "R"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-04-30", "journal": {"title": "BMC Public Health", "issn": "1471-2458", "volume": "21", "issue": "1", "pages": "833", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "The novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has seriously affected the lives of millions of people across the world.

The development of the global pandemic was evaluated in terms of the performance of single countries without trying to reflect on possible regional or sub-regional results of similar characteristics in health system and social contexts. To have a clearer view of the issue of sub-regional similarities, we examined the WHO, Eastern Mediterranean Region. When examining the development of confirmed cases for countries in the region, we identified four different sub-groups similar in the development of the pandemic and the social distancing measure implemented. Despite the complicated situation, these groups gave space for thinking outside the box of traditional outbreaks or pandemic response.

In the first step, we identify essential proteins from virus targets or their associated modules in human cells as possible drug target candidates. For this purpose, we apply two different algorithms to detect some candidate sets of proteins with a minimum size that drive a significant disruption in the COVID-19 related biological networks. We evaluate the resulted candidate proteins sets with three groups of drugs namely Covid-Drug, Clinical-Drug, and All-Drug. The obtained candidate proteins sets approve 16 drugs out of 18 in the Covid-Drug, 273 drugs out of 328 in the Clinical-Drug, and a large number of drugs in the All-Drug. In the second step, we study COVID-19 associated proteins sets and recognize proteins that are essential to disease pathology. This analysis is performed using DAVID to show and compare essential proteins that are contributed between the COVID-19 comorbidities.

Therapeutics to treat COVID-19 are an integral part of any such management strategy and there is a substantial unmet need for treatments for individuals most at risk of severe disease. This perspective review provides rationale of a combined therapeutic regimen of selective endothelin-A (ET-A) receptor antagonism and sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibition to treat COVID-19. Endothelin is a potent vasoconstrictor with pro-inflammatory and atherosclerotic effects. It is upregulated in a number of conditions including acute respiratory distress syndrome and cardiovascular disease. Endothelin mediates vasocontractility via endothelin (ET-A and ET-B) receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). ET-B receptors regulate endothelin clearance and are present on endothelial cells, where in contrast to their role on VSMCs, mediate vasodilation. Therefore, selective endothelin-A (ET-A) receptor inhibition is likely the optimal approach to attenuate the injurious effects of endothelin and may reduce ventilation-perfusion mismatch and pulmonary inflammation, whilst improving pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygenation. SGLT-2 inhibition may dampen inflammatory cytokines, reduce hyperglycaemia if present, improve endothelial function, cardiovascular haemodynamics and cellular bioenergetics. This combination therapeutic approach may therefore have beneficial effects to mitigate both the pulmonary, metabolic and cardiorenal manifestations of COVID-19. Given these drug classes include medicines licensed to treat heart failure, diabetes and pulmonary hypertension respectively, information regarding their safety profile is established.

Therefore, our present study aimed to (i) assess the prevalence of burnout and levels of job satisfaction among physicians in Jordan, and (ii) explore physicians' opinions, experiences, and perceptions during the pandemic crisis.\r\n\r\nThis was a mixed-method study that utilized a structured web-based questionnaire and semi-structured individual interviews. The 10-Item Burnout Measure-Short version (BMS), and the 5-Item Short Index of Job Satisfaction (SIJS) were adopted to assess occupational burnout and job satisfaction, respectively. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, based on a conceptual framework that was developed from Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory of Motivation and Job Demands-Resources Model. Descriptive statistics and regression models, as well as inductive thematic analysis, were used to analyze quantitative and qualitative data, respectively.\r\n\r\nA total of 973 survey responses and 11 interviews were included in our analysis. The prevalence of burnout among physicians was (57.7%). Several significant factors were positively associated with burnout, including female gender, working at highly loaded hospitals, working for long hours, doing night shifts, lack of sufficient access to personal protective equipment, and being positively tested for SARS-CoV-2. Regarding job satisfaction, regression analysis revealed that age was positively associated with higher levels of job satisfaction. On contrary, being a general practitioner or specialist, working at highly loaded hospitals, low salaries, and suffering from burnout have predicted lower levels of job satisfaction. Besides, four themes have emerged from the thematic analysis: (i) Work-induced psychological distress during the pandemic, (ii) Decision-driven satisfactory and dissatisfactory experiences, (iii) Impact of the pandemic on doctor-patient communication and professional skills, and (iv) Economic impacts of the pandemic crisis and lockdown.\r\n\r\nA significant physical and psychological burden was associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic prokaryotic organisms which represent a significant source of novel, bioactive, secondary metabolites, and they are also considered an abundant source of bioactive compounds/drugs, such as dolastatin, cryptophycin 1, curacin toyocamycin, phytoalexin, cyanovirin-N and phycocyanin. Some of these compounds have displayed promising results in successful Phase I, II, III and IV clinical trials. Additionally, the cyanobacterial compounds applied to medical research have demonstrated an exciting future with great potential to be developed into new medicines. Most of these compounds have exhibited strong pharmacological activities, including neurotoxicity, cytotoxicity and antiviral activity against HCMV, HSV-1, HHV-6 and HIV-1, so these metabolites could be promising candidates for COVID-19 treatment. Therefore, the effective large-scale production of natural marine products through synthesis is important for resolving the existing issues associated with chemical isolation, including small yields, and may be necessary to better investigate their biological activities. Herein, we highlight the total synthesized and stereochemical determinations of the cyanobacterial bioactive compounds.

However, in some infected individuals, this can progress to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to multi-organ failure and death. The purpose of this study is to explore the proteomic differences between mild, severe and critical COVID-19 positive patients. Blood protein profiling was performed on 59 COVID-19 mild (n=26), severe (n=9) or critical (n=24) cases and 28 controls using the OLINK inflammation, autoimmune, cardiovascular and neurology panels. Differential expression analysis was performed within and between disease groups to generate nine different analyses. From the 368 proteins measured per individual, more than 75% were observed to be significantly perturbed in COVID-19 cases. Six proteins (IL6, CKAP4, Gal-9, IL-1ra, LILRB4 and PD-L1) were identified to be associated with disease severity.

Studies indicate that RAAS imbalance worsens the prognosis in COVID-19. We present a consecutive retrospective COVID-19 cohort with findings of frequent pulmonary thromboembolism (17%), high pulmonary artery pressure (60%) and lung MRI perfusion disturbances. We demonstrate, in swine, that infusing angiotensin II or blocking ACE2 induces increased pulmonary artery pressure, reduces blood oxygenation, increases coagulation, disturbs lung perfusion, induces diffuse alveolar damage, and acute tubular necrosis compared to control animals.

Adults (n = 5389; median age = 31 years [interquartile range (IQR) = 25, 38]), previously engaged in RT prior to lockdown (median prior RT experience = 7 years [IQR = 4, 12]) participated. Outcomes were self-reported RT behaviours including: continuation of RT during lockdown, location of RT, purchase of specific equipment for RT, method of training, full-body or split routine, types of training, repetition ranges, exercise number, set volumes (per exercise and muscle group), weekly frequency of training, perception of effort, whether training was planned/recorded, time of day, and training goals. Secondary outcomes included motivation, perceived effectiveness, enjoyment, and intent to continue RT.\r\n\r\nA majority of individuals (82.8%) maintained participation in RT during-lockdown. Marginal probabilities from generalised linear models and generalised estimating equations for RT behaviours were largely similar from pre- to during-lockdown. There was reduced probability of training in privately owned gyms (~ 59% to ~ 7%) and increased probability of training at home (~ 18% to ~ 89%); greater probability of training using a full-body routine (~ 38% to ~ 51%); reduced probability of resistance machines (~ 66% to ~ 13%) and free weight use (~ 96% to ~ 81%), and increased probability of bodyweight training (~ 62% to ~ 82%); reduced probability of moderate repetition ranges (~ 62-82% to ~ 55-66%) and greater probability of higher repetition ranges (~ 27% to ~ 49%); and moderate reduction in the perception of effort experienced during-training (r = 0.31). Further, individuals were slightly less likely to plan or record training during lockdown and many changed their training goals. Additionally, perceived effectiveness, enjoyment, and likelihood of continuing current training were all lower during-lockdown.\r\n\r\nThose engaged in RT prior to lockdown these behaviours with only slight adaptations in both location and types of training performed. However, people employed less effort, had lower motivation, and perceived training as less effective and enjoyable, reporting their likelihood of continuing current training was similar or lower than pre-lockdown. These results have implications for strategies to maintain engagement in positive health behaviours such as RT during-restrictive pandemic-related public health measures.

We examined various immune parameters including the markers of immune cells exhaustion and activation in 21 patients with COVID-19 disease hospitalised in our hospital during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Slovakia. The results showed significant progressive lymphopenia and depletion of lymphocyte subsets (CD3 +, CD4+, CD8+ and CD19+) in correlation to the disease severity. Clinical recovery was associated with significant increase in CD3+ and CD3+CD4+ T-cells. Most of our patients had eosinopenia on admission, although no significant differences were seen among groups with different disease severity. Non-survivors, when compared to survivors, had significantly increased expression of PD-1 on CD4+ and CD8+ cells, but no significant difference in Tim-3 expression was observed, what suggests possible reversibility of immune paralysis in the most severe group of patients. During recovery, the expression of Tim-3 on both CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ cells significantly decreased. Moreover, patients with fatal outcome had significantly higher proportion of CD38+CD8+ cells and lower proportion of CD38+HLA-DR+CD8+ cells on admission. Clinical recovery was associated with significant decrease of proportion of CD38+CD8+ cells. The highest AUC values within univariate and multivariate logistic regression were achieved for expression of CD38 on CD8+ cells and expression of PD1 on CD4+ cells alone or combined, what suggests, that these parameters could be used as potential biomarkers of poor outcome. The assessment of immune markers could help in predicting outcome and disease severity in COVID-19 patients. Our observations suggest, that apart from the degree of depletion of total lymphocytes and lymphocytes subsets, increased expression of CD38 on CD3+CD8+ cells alone or combined with increased expression of PD-1 on CD3+CD4+ cells, should be regarded as a risk factor of an unfavourable outcome in COVID-19 patients. Increased expression of PD-1 in the absence of an increased expression of Tim-3 on CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ cells suggests potential reversibility of ongoing immune paralysis in patients with the most severe course of COVID-19.", "doi": "10.3389/fcimb.2021.646688", "pmid": "33937096", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Public Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC8082075"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-05-04T15:59:00.820Z", "modified": "2021-05-04T15:59:29.077Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "3f9371406eef47b4b4cb3d96d22bf226", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/3f9371406eef47b4b4cb3d96d22bf226.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/3f9371406eef47b4b4cb3d96d22bf226"}}, "title": "Coronavirus Disease 19 from the Perspective of Ageing with Focus on Nutritional Status and Nutrition Management-A Narrative Review.", "authors": [{"family": "Rothenberg", "given": "Elisabet", "initials": "E"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-04-14", "journal": {"title": "Nutrients", "issn": "2072-6643", "volume": "13", "issue": "4", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (COVID-19) has hit older adults harder due to a combination of age-related immunological and metabolic alterations.

Effective market segmentation improves the communication and efficacy of health advice. Travel frequency is an important basis for health-related consumer segmentation, as it is closely related to risk of greater exposure to infectious diseases. Theoretically grounded studies of tourist biosecurity behavior and travel frequency have largely been neglected, although insights into practices and attitudes are especially relevant for coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19 (coronavirus disease of 2019) health responses. Therefore, this research constructed and tested a conceptual model applying Value-Attitude-Behavior theory to US travelers to see whether the frequency of international travel affected tourist COVID-19 related biosecurity behavior. US respondents were drawn from a panel using a quota sampling technique according to the age and gender of American outbound tourists. An online survey was administered in September 2020. The responses (n = 395) of those who traveled internationally within five years were analyzed utilizing partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) with multi-group analysis. Travel frequency significantly affects biosecurity behavior. High travel frequency (\u22658 trips) has the strongest effect of value on biosecurity attitudes, personal norms, social norms, and biosecurity social norms, leading to biosecurity behaviors. Biosecurity behaviors pertaining to medium travel frequency (4-7 trips) are significantly influenced by personal norms. At low travel frequency (1-3 trips) levels, biosecurity behaviors are stimulated by biosecurity attitudes and social norms, showing the highest predictive power among the three groups. This work provides insights into international travel consumer biosecurity practices and behavior. From a market segmentation perspective, the levels of international travel frequency have various influences on biosecurity values, attitudes, personal norms, social norms, and behaviors. The biosecurity behaviors of low-frequency travelers are found to be the most significant of the three groups, suggesting that individuals who travel less frequently are more likely to practice responsible COVID-19 biosecurity behavior.", "doi": "10.3390/ijerph18084111", "pmid": "33924641", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "ijerph18084111"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC8068867"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-05-04T16:22:01.814Z", "modified": "2021-05-04T16:22:01.829Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "2a61f282b9484a34bfe7e8b39ea3d2f4", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/2a61f282b9484a34bfe7e8b39ea3d2f4.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/2a61f282b9484a34bfe7e8b39ea3d2f4"}}, "title": "A Deferred-Vaccination Design to Assess Durability of COVID-19 Vaccine Effect After the Placebo Group Is Vaccinated.", "authors": [{"family": "Follmann", "given": "Dean", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Fintzi", "given": "Jonathan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Fay", "given": "Michael P", "initials": "MP"}, {"family": "Janes", "given": "Holly E", "initials": "HE"}, {"family": "Baden", "given": "Lindsey R", "initials": "LR"}, {"family": "El Sahly", "given": "Hana M", "initials": "HM"}, {"family": "Fleming", "given": "Thomas R", "initials": "TR"}, {"family": "Mehrotra", "given": "Devan V", "initials": "DV"}, {"family": "Carpp", "given": "Lindsay N", "initials": "LN"}, {"family": "Juraska", "given": "Michal", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Benkeser", "given": "David", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Donnell", "given": "Deborah", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Fong", "given": "Youyi", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Han", "given": "Shu", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Hirsch", "given": "Ian", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Huang", "given": "Ying", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Huang", "given": "Yunda", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Hyrien", "given": "Ollivier", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Luedtke", "given": "Alex", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Carone", "given": "Marco", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Nason", "given": "Martha", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Vandebosch", "given": "An", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Zhou", "given": "Honghong", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Cho", "given": "Iksung", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Gabriel", "given": "Erin", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Kublin", "given": "James G", "initials": "JG"}, {"family": "Cohen", "given": "Myron S", "initials": "MS"}, {"family": "Corey", "given": "Lawrence", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Gilbert", "given": "Peter B", "initials": "PB"}, {"family": "Neuzil", "given": "Kathleen M", "initials": "KM"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-04-13", "journal": {"title": "Ann Intern Med", "issn": "1539-3704", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": "0003-4819"}, "abstract": "Multiple candidate vaccines to prevent COVID-19 have entered large-scale phase 3 placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials, and several have demonstrated substantial short-term efficacy. At some point after demonstration of substantial efficacy, placebo recipients should be offered the efficacious vaccine from their trial, which will occur before longer-term efficacy and safety are known. The absence of a placebo group could compromise assessment of longer-term vaccine effects. However, by continuing follow-up after vaccination of the placebo group, this study shows that placebo-controlled vaccine efficacy can be mathematically derived by assuming that the benefit of vaccination over time has the same profile for the original vaccine recipients and the original placebo recipients after their vaccination. Although this derivation provides less precise estimates than would be obtained by a standard trial where the placebo group remains unvaccinated, this proposed approach allows estimation of longer-term effect, including durability of vaccine efficacy and whether the vaccine eventually becomes harmful for some. Deferred vaccination, if done open-label, may lead to riskier behavior in the unblinded original vaccine group, confounding estimates of long-term vaccine efficacy. Hence, deferred vaccination via blinded crossover, where the vaccine group receives placebo and vice versa, would be the preferred way to assess vaccine durability and potential delayed harm. Deferred vaccination allows placebo recipients timely access to the vaccine when it would no longer be proper to maintain them on placebo, yet still allows important insights about immunologic and

Concerns have been expressed that, at their most extreme, these consequences could manifest as increased suicide rates. We aimed to assess the early effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide rates around the world.\r\n\r\nWe sourced real-time suicide data from countries or areas within countries through a systematic internet search and recourse to our networks and the published literature. Between Sept 1 and Nov 1, 2020, we searched the official websites of these countries' ministries of health, police agencies, and government-run statistics agencies or equivalents, using the translated search terms \"suicide\" and \"cause of death\", before broadening the search in an attempt to identify data through other public sources. Data were included from a given country or area if they came from an official government source and were available at a monthly level from at least Jan 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020. Our internet searches were restricted to countries with more than 3 million residents for pragmatic reasons, but we relaxed this rule for countries identified through the literature and our networks. Areas within countries could also be included with populations of less than 3 million. We used an interrupted time-series analysis to model the trend in monthly suicides before COVID-19 (from at least Jan 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020) in each country or area within a country, comparing the expected number of suicides derived from the model with the observed number of suicides in the early months of the pandemic (from April 1 to July 31, 2020, in the primary analysis).\r\n\r\nWe sourced data from 21 countries (16 high-income and five upper-middle-income countries), including whole-country data in ten countries and data for various areas in 11 countries). Rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs based on the observed versus expected numbers of suicides showed no evidence of a significant increase in risk of suicide since the pandemic began in any country or area. There was statistical evidence of a decrease in suicide compared with the expected number in 12 countries or areas: New South Wales, Australia (RR 0\u00b781 [95% CI 0\u00b772-0\u00b791]); Alberta, Canada (0\u00b780 [0\u00b768-0\u00b793]); British Columbia, Canada (0\u00b776 [0\u00b766-0\u00b787]); Chile (0\u00b785 [0\u00b778-0\u00b794]); Leipzig, Germany (0\u00b749 [0\u00b732-0\u00b774]); Japan (0\u00b794 [0\u00b791-0\u00b796]); New Zealand (0\u00b779 [0\u00b768-0\u00b791]); South Korea (0\u00b794 [0\u00b792-0\u00b797]); California, USA (0\u00b790 [0\u00b785-0\u00b795]); Illinois (Cook County), USA (0\u00b779 [0\u00b767-0\u00b793]); Texas (four counties), USA (0\u00b782 [0\u00b768-0\u00b798]); and Ecuador (0\u00b774 [0\u00b767-0\u00b782]).\r\n\r\nThis is the first study to examine suicides occurring in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in multiple countries.

Meanwhile, myocardial infarction is and will probably remain the foremost cause of death in the western world throughout the coming decades. Severe deregulation of the immune system can unnecessarily expand the inflammatory response and participate in target and multiple organ failure, in infection but also in critical illness. Indeed, the course and fate of inflammatory cells observed in severe ST-elevation myocardial infarction (neutrophilia, monocytosis and lymphopenia) almost perfectly mirror those recently reported in severe coronavirus disease 2019. A pleiotropic proinflammatory imbalance hampers adaptive immunity in favor of uncontrolled innate immunity and is associated with poorer structural and clinical outcomes. The goal of the present review is to gain greater insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this canonical activation and downregulation of the two arms of the immune response in both entities, to better understand their pathophysiology as well as to open the door to innovative therapeutic options.

Data was gathered from 710 adults experiencing tinnitus in Western Europe, with the majority living in The Netherlands, Belgium, and Sweden. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis and descriptive statistics.\n\nThose with tinnitus indicated the following support needs during the pandemic (a) support for tinnitus, (b) support for hearing-related difficulties, (c) social support, and (d) pandemic-related support. Five directions for future tinnitus care were provided, namely (a) need for understanding professional support and access to multidisciplinary experts, (b) greater range of therapies and resources, (c) access to more information about tinnitus, (d) prioritizing tinnitus research, and (e) more support for hearing protection and hearing loss prevention CONCLUSIONS: The findings point to the need for accessible (remote), patient-centred, suitable and evidence-based tinnitus care.

The importance of RWE derived from RWD has been once again demonstrated during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as it can improve patient care by complementing information obtained from traditional clinical trial programs. Additionally, RWE can generate insights into disease mechanisms, epidemiology, patient flows in and out of healthcare systems, and drivers and barriers to optimal clinical care in real-world settings. Identifying unmet medical needs is crucial as it often can inform which investigational new drugs enter clinical trial testing, and RWE studies from hospital settings have contributed substantial progress here.

We hypothesised that the widespread use of inhaled glucocorticoids among these patients was responsible for this finding, and tested if inhaled glucocorticoids would be an effective treatment for early COVID-19.\n\nWe performed an open-label, parallel-group, phase 2, randomised controlled trial (Steroids in COVID-19; STOIC) of inhaled budesonide, compared with usual care, in adults within 7 days of the onset of mild COVID-19 symptoms. The trial was done in the community in Oxfordshire, UK. Participants were randomly assigned to inhaled budsonide or usual care stratified for age (\u226440 years or >40 years), sex (male or female), and number of comorbidities (\u22641 and \u22652). Randomisation was done using random sequence generation in block randomisation in a 1:1 ratio. Budesonide dry powder was delivered using a turbohaler at a dose of 800 \u03bcg per actuation. Participants were asked to take two inhalations twice a day until symptom resolution. The primary endpoint was COVID-19-related urgent care visit, including emergency department assessment or hospitalisation, analysed for both the per-protocol and intention-to-treat (ITT) populations. The secondary outcomes were self-reported clinical recovery (symptom resolution), viral symptoms measured using the Common Cold Questionnare (CCQ) and the InFLUenza Patient Reported Outcome Questionnaire (FLUPro), body temperature, blood oxygen saturations, and SARS-CoV-2 viral load. The trial was stopped early after independent statistical review concluded that study outcome would not change with further participant enrolment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04416399.\n\nFrom July 16 to Dec 9, 2020, 167 participants were recruited and assessed for eligibility. 21 did not meet eligibility criteria and were excluded. 146 participants were randomly assigned-73 to usual care and 73 to budesonide. For the per-protocol population (n=139), the primary outcome occurred in ten (14%) of 70 participants in the budesonide group and one (1%) of 69 participant in the usual care group (difference in proportions 0\u00b7131, 95% CI 0\u00b7043 to 0\u00b7218; p=0\u00b7004). For the ITT population, the primary outcome occurred in 11 (15%) participants in the usual care group and two (3%) participants in the budesonide group (difference in proportions 0\u00b7123, 95% CI 0\u00b7033 to 0\u00b7213; p=0\u00b7009). The number needed to treat with inhaled budesonide to reduce COVID-19 deterioration was eight. Clinical recovery was 1 day shorter in the budesonide group compared with the usual care group (median 7 days [95% CI 6 to 9] in the budesonide group vs 8 days [7 to 11] in the usual care group; log-rank test p=0\u00b7007). The mean proportion of days with a fever in the first 14 days was lower in the budesonide group (2%, SD 6) than the usual care group (8%, SD 18; Wilcoxon test p=0\u00b7051) and the proportion of participants with at least 1 day of fever was lower in the budesonide group when compared with the usual care group. As-needed antipyretic medication was required for fewer proportion of days in the budesonide group compared with the usual care group (27% [IQR 0-50] vs 50% [15-71]; p=0\u00b7025) Fewer participants randomly assigned to budesonide had persistent symptoms at days 14 and 28 compared with participants receiving usual care (difference in proportions 0\u00b7204, 95% CI 0\u00b7075 to 0\u00b7334; p=0\u00b7003). The mean total score change in the CCQ and FLUPro over 14 days was significantly better in the budesonide group compared with the usual care group (CCQ mean difference -0\u00b712, 95% CI -0\u00b721 to -0\u00b702 [p=0\u00b7016]; FLUPro mean difference -0\u00b710, 95% CI -0\u00b721 to -0\u00b700 [p=0\u00b7044]). Blood oxygen saturations and SARS-CoV-2 load, measured by cycle threshold, were not different between the groups. Budesonide was safe, with only five (7%) participants reporting self-limiting adverse events.\n\nEarly administration of inhaled budesonide reduced the likelihood of needing urgent medical care and reduced time to recovery after early COVID-19.\n\nNational Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre and AstraZeneca.", "doi": "10.1016/S2213-2600(21)00160-0", "pmid": "33844996", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Drug Discovery": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S2213-2600(21)00160-0"}, {"db": "ClinicalTrials.gov", "key": "NCT04416399"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-04-13T10:27:27.629Z", "modified": "2021-04-13T10:29:15.226Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "1ddde94149764d01800ae09c16c2abed", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/1ddde94149764d01800ae09c16c2abed.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/1ddde94149764d01800ae09c16c2abed"}}, "title": "Actionable druggable genome-wide Mendelian randomization identifies repurposing opportunities for COVID-19.", "authors": [{"family": "Gaziano", "given": "Liam", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Giambartolomei", "given": "Claudia", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Pereira", "given": "Alexandre C", "initials": "AC"}, {"family": "Gaulton", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Posner", "given": "Daniel C", "initials": "DC"}, {"family": "Swanson", "given": "Sonja A", "initials": "SA"}, {"family": "Ho", "given": "Yuk-Lam", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Iyengar", "given": "Sudha K", "initials": "SK"}, {"family": "Kosik", "given": "Nicole M", "initials": "NM"}, {"family": "Vujkovic", "given": "Marijana", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Gagnon", "given": "David R", "initials": "DR"}, {"family": "Bento", "given": "A Patr\u00edcia", "initials": "AP"}, {"family": "Barrio-Hernandez", "given": "Inigo", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "R\u00f6nnblom", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Hagberg", "given": "Niklas", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Lundtoft", "given": "Christian", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Langenberg", "given": "Claudia", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Pietzner", "given": "Maik", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Valentine", "given": "Dennis", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Gustincich", "given": "Stefano", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Tartaglia", "given": "Gian Gaetano", "initials": "GG"}, {"family": "Allara", "given": "Elias", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Surendran", "given": "Praveen", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Burgess", "given": "Stephen", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Zhao", "given": "Jing Hua", "initials": "JH"}, {"family": "Peters", "given": "James E", "initials": "JE"}, {"family": "Prins", "given": "Bram P", "initials": "BP"}, {"family": "Angelantonio", "given": "Emanuele Di", "initials": "ED"}, {"family": "Devineni", "given": "Poornima", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Shi", "given": "Yunling", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Lynch", "given": "Kristine E", "initials": "KE"}, {"family": "DuVall", "given": "Scott L", "initials": "SL"}, {"family": "Garcon", "given": "Helene", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Thomann", "given": "Lauren O", "initials": "LO"}, {"family": "Zhou", "given": "Jin J", "initials": "JJ"}, {"family": "Gorman", "given": "Bryan R", "initials": "BR"}, {"family": "Huffman", "given": "Jennifer E", "initials": "JE"}, {"family": "O'Donnell", "given": "Christopher J", "initials": "CJ"}, {"family": "Tsao", "given": "Philip S", "initials": "PS"}, {"family": "Beckham", "given": "Jean C", "initials": "JC"}, {"family": "Pyarajan", "given": "Saiju", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Muralidhar", "given": "Sumitra", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Huang", "given": "Grant D", "initials": "GD"}, {"family": "Ramoni", "given": "Rachel", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Beltrao", "given": "Pedro", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Danesh", "given": "John", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Hung", "given": "Adriana M", "initials": "AM"}, {"family": "Chang", "given": "Kyong-Mi", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Sun", "given": "Yan V", "initials": "YV"}, {"family": "Joseph", "given": "Jacob", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Leach", "given": "Andrew R", "initials": "AR"}, {"family": "Edwards", "given": "Todd L", "initials": "TL"}, {"family": "Cho", "given": "Kelly", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Gaziano", "given": "J Michael", "initials": "JM"}, {"family": "Butterworth", "given": "Adam S", "initials": "AS"}, {"family": "Casas", "given": "Juan P", "initials": "JP"}, {"family": "VA Million Veteran Program COVID-19 Science Initiative", "given": "", "initials": ""}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-04-09", "journal": {"title": "Nat Med", "issn": "1546-170X", "issn-l": "1078-8956", "volume": "27", "issue": "4", "pages": "668-676"}, "abstract": "Drug repurposing provides a rapid approach to meet the urgent need for therapeutics to address COVID-19.

Samples were collected during the most critical circumstances that occurred so far within the COVID-19 pandemics in Serbia.

Previous investigations have suggested that viral diseases can spread through contaminants or contaminated surfaces. The transmission of viruses via polluted surfaces relies upon their capacity to maintain their infectivity while they are in the environment. Here, a range of materials that are widely used to manufacture personal protective equipment (PPE) are summarized, as these offer effective disinfection solutions and are the environmental variables that influence virus survival. Infection modes and prevention as well as disinfection and PPE disposal strategies are discussed. A coronavirus-like enveloped virus can live in the environment after being discharged from a host organism until it infects another healthy individual. Transmission of enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 can occur even without direct contact, although detailed knowledge of airborne routes and other indirect transmission paths is still lacking. Ground transmission of viruses is also possible via wastewater discharges. While enveloped viruses can contaminate potable water and wastewater through human excretions such as feces and droplets, careless PPE disposal can also lead to their transmission into our environment. This paper also highlights the possibility that viruses can be transmitted into the environment from PPE kits used by healthcare and emergency service personnel. A simulation-based approach was developed to understand the transport mechanism for coronavirus and similar enveloped viruses in the environment through porous media, and preliminary results from this model are presented here. Those results indicate that viruses can move through porous soil and eventually contaminate groundwater. This paper therefore underlines the importance of proper PPE disposal by healthcare workers in the Mediterranean region and around the world.", "doi": "10.1007/s41207-021-00251-w", "pmid": "33842691", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "251"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC8024444"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-04-13T09:37:59.682Z", "modified": "2021-04-13T10:15:55.648Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "3b2eb5d7df4c423fb1850f747e0c19ee", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/3b2eb5d7df4c423fb1850f747e0c19ee.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/3b2eb5d7df4c423fb1850f747e0c19ee"}}, "title": "Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in Patients With COVID-19: An International Multicenter Cohort Study.", "authors": [{"family": "Raasveld", "given": "Senta Jorinde", "initials": "SJ"}, {"family": "Delnoij", "given": "Thijs S R", "initials": "TSR"}, {"family": "Broman", "given": "Lars M", "initials": "LM"}, {"family": "Lansink-Hartgring", "given": "Annemieke Oude", "initials": "AO"}, {"family": "Hermans", "given": "Greet", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "De Troy", "given": "Erwin", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Taccone", "given": "Fabio S", "initials": "FS"}, {"family": "Quintana Diaz", "given": "Manuel", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "van der Velde", "given": "Franciska", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Miranda", "given": "Dinis Dos Reis", "initials": "DDR"}, {"family": "Scholten", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "ETALON Study Group", "given": "", "initials": ""}, {"family": "Vlaar", "given": "Alexander P J", "initials": "APJ"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-04-07", "journal": {"title": "J Intensive Care Med", "issn": "1525-1489", "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": "8850666211007063", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "To report and compare the characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to non-COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients on ECMO.\n\nWe performed an international retrospective study of COVID-19 patients on ECMO from 13 intensive care units from March 1 to April 30, 2020.

Most used social media to stay up to date on cancer care in general (62.5%) and cancer care during COVID-19 (61%) given the constant flow of information. Respondents also used social media to interact with other oncologists (78.8%) and with patients (34.4%). Overall, 61.1% of respondents were satisfied with the role that social media was playing during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, 41.1% of respondents reported trouble in discriminating between credible and less credible information and 30% stated social networks were a source of stress. For this reason, one-third of respondents reduced its use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regarding meeting attendance, a total of 59.1% of responding physicians preferred in-person meetings to virtual ones, and 51.8% agreed that virtual meetings and social distancing could hamper effective collaboration.\n\nSocial media has a useful role in supporting cancer care and professional engagement in oncology. Although one-third of respondents reported reduced use of social media due to stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority found social media useful to keep up to date and were satisfied with the role social media was playing during the pandemic.", "doi": "10.1016/j.esmoop.2021.100104", "pmid": "33838532", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S2059-7029(21)00061-2"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-04-12T15:37:58.350Z", "modified": "2021-04-12T15:37:58.364Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "f76c3e11e2094a3db5ca89e4e76dac36", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/f76c3e11e2094a3db5ca89e4e76dac36.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/f76c3e11e2094a3db5ca89e4e76dac36"}}, "title": "Heparin binding protein in severe COVID-19-A prospective observational cohort study.", "authors": [{"family": "Mellhammar", "given": "Lisa", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Thelaus", "given": "Louise", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "El\u00e9n", "given": "Sixten", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Fisher", "given": "Jane", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Linder", "given": "Adam", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-04-06", "journal": {"title": "PLoS One", "issn": "1932-6203", "volume": "16", "issue": "4", "pages": "e0249570", "issn-l": "1932-6203"}, "abstract": "Neutrophil-derived heparin binding protein (HBP; also known as azurocidin or CAP-37) is a key player in bacterial sepsis and a promising biomarker in severe infections. The aims of this study were to assess whether HBP is involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and, if so, whether it can be used to predict severe disease preferably using a point-of-care test.\n\nThis was a prospective convenience sample study of biomarkers in patients admitted to Sk\u00e5ne University hospital in Sweden with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. Plasma samples and clinical data were collected within 72h after admission, during hospital stay and at discharge. Plasma HBP concentrations samples were measured both with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and with a novel dry immunofluorescence analyzer (Joinstar) point-of-care test.\n\nThirty-five COVID-19 patients were enrolled in the study. Twenty-nine patients had blood samples taken within 72h after admission. We compared the highest HBP value taken within 72h after admission in patients who eventually developed organ dysfunction (n = 23) compared to those who did not (n = 6), and found that HBP was significantly elevated in those who developed organ dysfunction (25.0 ng/mL (interquartile range (IQR) 16.6-48.5) vs 10.6 ng/mL (IQR 4.8-21.7 ng/mL), p = 0.03). Point-of-care test measurements correlated well with ELISA measurements (R = 0.83).

We investigated whether there was a change in the incidence of ankle fractures seen at 7 selected hospitals during the Covid-19 pandemic 2020.Patients and methods - Data on all ankle fractures treated at 7 selected departments during March 15 through June 15, 2020, and for the same period in the preceding 3 years (2017-2019), was retrieved from the Swedish Fracture Register. The number of fractures during the whole period and subsequent 30-day periods were compared between 2020 and 2017-2019, including subgroup analyses of age and sex.Results - The monthly rate of ankle fractures was reduced by 14% in 2020 (139 fractures) compared with 2017-2019 (161 fractures).

organs and increased risk for severe anaphylaxis in patients with concomitant allergies. Covid-19 is a pandemic that is associated with a relatively high rate of severe lung disease and mortality. The mortality is particularly high in those with certain comorbidities and increases with age. Recently, several companies have developed an effective vaccination against Covid-19. Although the reported frequency of severe side effects is low, there is an emerging discussion about the safety of Covid-19 vaccination in patients with severe allergies and mastocytosis. However, even in these patients, severe adverse reactions are rare. We therefore recommend the broad use of Covid-19 vaccination in patients with mastocytosis on a global basis. The only well-established exception is a known or suspected allergy against a constituent of the vaccine. Safety measures, including premedication and post-vaccination observation should be considered in all patients with mastocytosis, depending on the individual personal risk and overall situation in each case. The current article provides a summary of published data, observations and expert opinion that form the basis of these recommendations.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jaip.2021.03.041", "pmid": "33831618", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S2213-2198(21)00386-X"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-04-09T16:46:32.560Z", "modified": "2021-04-23T16:05:54.583Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "4cf20ca7e7dd4720962ed406c5e2c909", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/4cf20ca7e7dd4720962ed406c5e2c909.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/4cf20ca7e7dd4720962ed406c5e2c909"}}, "title": "In Silico Mining of Terpenes from Red-Sea Invertebrates for SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease (M pro) Inhibitors.", "authors": [{"family": "Ibrahim", "given": "Mahmoud A A", "initials": "MAA"}, {"family": "Abdelrahman", "given": "Alaa H M", "initials": "AHM"}, {"family": "Mohamed", "given": "Tarik A", "initials": "TA"}, {"family": "Atia", "given": "Mohamed A M", "initials": "MAM"}, {"family": "Al-Hammady", "given": "Montaser A M", "initials": "MAM"}, {"family": "Abdeljawaad", "given": "Khlood A A", "initials": "KAA"}, {"family": "Elkady", "given": "Eman M", "initials": "EM"}, {"family": "Moustafa", "given": "Mahmoud F", "initials": "MF"}, {"family": "Alrumaihi", "given": "Faris", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Allemailem", "given": "Khaled S", "initials": "KS"}, {"family": "El-Seedi", "given": "Hesham R", "initials": "HR"}, {"family": "Par\u00e9", "given": "Paul W", "initials": "PW"}, {"family": "Efferth", "given": "Thomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Hegazy", "given": "Mohamed-Elamir F", "initials": "MF"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-04-05", "journal": {"title": "Molecules", "issn": "1420-3049", "volume": "26", "issue": "7", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent for the COVID-19 pandemic, which generated more than 1.82 million deaths in 2020 alone, in addition to 83.8 million infections. Currently, there is no antiviral medication to treat COVID-19. In the search for drug leads, marine-derived metabolites are reported here as prospective SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. Two hundred and twenty-seven terpene natural products isolated from the biodiverse Red-Sea ecosystem were screened for inhibitor activity against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro) using molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area binding energy calculations. On the basis of in silico analyses, six terpenes demonstrated high potency as Mpro inhibitors with \u0394Gbinding \u2264 -40.0 kcal/mol. The stability and binding affinity of the most potent metabolite, erylosides B, were compared to the human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitor, lopinavir. Erylosides B showed greater binding affinity towards SARS-CoV-2 Mpro than lopinavir over 100 ns with \u0394Gbinding values of -51.9 vs. -33.6 kcal/mol, respectively. Protein-protein interactions indicate that erylosides B biochemical signaling shares gene components that mediate severe acute respiratory syndrome diseases, including the cytokine- and immune-signaling components BCL2L1, IL2, and PRKC. Pathway enrichment analysis and Boolean network modeling were performed towards a deep dissection and mining of the erylosides B target-function interactions.

We present a stealth labeling approach that can efficiently, and with high fidelity, generate RNA transcripts, through enzymatic incorporation of the triphosphate of tC O, a fluorescent tricyclic cytosine analogue. We demonstrate this by incorporation of tCO in up to 100% of the natural cytosine positions of a 1.2 kb mRNA encoding for the histone H2B fused to GFP (H2B:GFP). Spectroscopic characterization of this mRNA shows that the incorporation rate of tCO is similar to cytosine, which allows for efficient labeling and controlled tuning of labeling ratios for different applications. Using live cell confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, we show that the tCO-labeled mRNA is efficiently translated into H2B:GFP inside human cells. Hence, we not only develop the use of fluorescent base analogue labeling of nucleic acids in live-cell microscopy but also, importantly, show that the resulting transcript is translated into the correct protein. Moreover, the spectral properties of our transcripts and their translation product allow for their straightforward, simultaneous visualization in live cells. Finally, we find that chemically transfected tCO-labeled RNA, unlike a state-of-the-art fluorescently labeled RNA, gives rise to expression of a similar amount of protein as its natural counterpart, hence representing a methodology for studying natural, unperturbed processing of mRNA used in RNA therapeutics and in vaccines, like the ones developed against SARS-CoV-2.", "doi":

The COVID-19 vaccines are expected to have similar positive impacts on health across the globe. While serious allergic reactions to vaccines are rare, their underlying mechanisms and implications for clinical management should be considered to provide individuals with the safest care possible. In this review, we provide an overview of different types of allergic adverse reactions that can potentially occur aftervaccination and individual vaccine components capable of causing the allergic adverse reactions.

However, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, prehospital and in-hospital emergency procedures faced unprecedented challenges, which might have caused a decline in the number of acute reperfusion therapy applied and led to a worsening of key quality measures for this treatment during lockdown.\n\nThis prospective multicenter cohort study used data from the TRISP (Thrombolysis in Ischemic Stroke Patients) registry of patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with reperfusion therapies, that is, intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular therapy. We compared prehospital and in-hospital time-based performance measures (stroke-onset-to-admission, admission-to-treatment, admission-to-image, and image-to-treatment time) during the first 6 weeks after announcement of lockdown (lockdown period) with the same period in 2019 (reference period). Secondary outcomes included stroke severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) after 24 hours and occurrence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (following the ECASS [European-Australasian Acute Stroke Study]-II criteria).\n\nAcross 20 stroke centers, 540 patients were treated with intravenous thrombolysis/endovascular therapy during lockdown period compared with 578 patients during reference period (-7% [95% CI, 5%-9%]). Performance measures did not change significantly during the lockdown period (2020/2019 minutes median: onset-to-admission 133/145; admission-to-treatment 51/48).

It is important to quantify the error rates of test equipment under field conditions, which might differ significantly from those obtained in the laboratory. A literature review on SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used to construct a clinical test confusion matrix. A simple correction method for bulk test results is then demonstrated with examples. The required sensitivity and specificity of a test are explored for societal needs and use cases, before a sequential analysis of common example scenarios is explored. The analysis suggests that many of the people with mild symptoms and positive test results are unlikely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in some regions. It is concluded that current and foreseen alternative tests can not be used to \"clear\" people as being non-infected. Recommendations are given that regional authorities must establish a programme to monitor operational test characteristics before launching large scale testing; and that large scale testing for tracing infection networks in some regions is not viable, but may be possible in a focused way that does not exceed the working capacity of the laboratories staffed by competent experts. RT-PCR tests can not be solely relied upon as the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis at scale, instead clinical assessment supported by a range of expert diagnostic tests should be used.", "doi": "10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06905", "pmid": "33937546", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S2405-8440(21)01008-2"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC8080131"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-05-04T15:58:32.202Z", "modified": "2021-05-04T15:58:32.212Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "9931c97142514ddaa8f78e17e737d5fd", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/9931c97142514ddaa8f78e17e737d5fd.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/9931c97142514ddaa8f78e17e737d5fd"}}, "title": "Dependence of SARS-CoV-2 infection on cholesterol-rich lipid raft and endosomal acidification", "authors": [{"family": "Li", "given": "Xiaowei", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "Zhu", "given": "Wenhua", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Fan", "given": "Meiyang", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Zhang", "given": "Jing", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Peng", "given": "Yizhao", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Huang", "given": "Fumeng", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Wang", "given": "Nan", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "He", "given": "Langchong", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Zhang", "given": "Lei", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Holmdahl", "given": "Rikard", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Meng", "given": "Liesu", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Lu", "given": "Shemin", "initials": "S"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2021-04-00", "journal": {"title": "Comput Struct Biotechnol J", "issn": "2001-0370", "issn-l": "2001-0370", "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": null}, "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 is a kind of viral pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, the mechanism whereby SARS-CoV-2 invades host cells remains poorly understood. Here we used SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses to infect human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressing HEK293T cells and evaluated virus infection. We confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 entry was dependent on ACE2 and sensitive to pH of endosome/lysosome in HEK293T cells. The infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses is independent of dynamin, clathrin, caveolin and endophilin A2, as well as macropinocytosis. Instead, we found that the infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses was cholesterol-rich lipid raft dependent. Cholesterol depletion of cell membranes with methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin resulted in reduction of pseudovirus infection. The infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses resumed with cholesterol supplementation. Together, cholesterol-rich lipid rafts, and endosomal acidification, are key steps of SARS-CoV-2 required for infection of host cells. Therefore, our finding expands the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanism and provides a new anti-SARS-CoV-2 strategy.", "doi": "10.1016/j.csbj.2021.04.001", "pmid": "33850607", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Biochemistry": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-04-15T10:33:48.387Z", "modified": "2021-04-21T08:55:37.850Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "980eb41a0b4c42ee9233958785cdf896", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/980eb41a0b4c42ee9233958785cdf896.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/980eb41a0b4c42ee9233958785cdf896"}}, "title": "Meteorological conditions are heterogeneous factors for COVID-19 risk in China", "authors": [{"family": "Xiao", "given": "Shuang", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Qi", "given": "Hongchao", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Ward", "given": "Michael P", "initials": "MP"}, {"family": "Wang", "given": "Wenge", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Zhang", "given": "Jun", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Chen", "given": "Yue", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Bergquist", "given": "Robert", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Tu", "given": "Wei", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Shi", "given": "Runye", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Hong", "given": "Jie", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Su", "given": "Qing", "initials": "Q"}, {"family": "Zhao", "given": "Zheng", "initials": "Z"}, {"family": "Ba", "given": "Jianbo", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Zhang", "given": "Zhijie", "initials": "Z"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2021-04-00", "journal": {"title": "Environ Res", "issn": "0013-9351", "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": "111182", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.envres.2021.111182", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Other": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-04-20T17:52:22.865Z", "modified": "2021-04-23T16:06:36.046Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "95af88ba4a9a4369936c0f0d5dcea2d8", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/95af88ba4a9a4369936c0f0d5dcea2d8.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/95af88ba4a9a4369936c0f0d5dcea2d8"}}, "title": "Undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcome in patients with acute MI and no COVID-19 symptoms.", "authors": [{"family": "Akhtar", "given": "Zubair", "initials": "Z"}, {"family": "Chowdhury", "given": "Fahmida", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Aleem", "given": "Mohammad Abdul", "initials": "MA"}, {"family": "Ghosh", "given": "Probir Kumar", "initials": "PK"}, {"family": "Rahman", "given": "Mahmudur", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Rahman", "given": "Mustafizur", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Hossain", "given": "Mohammad Enayet", "initials": "ME"}, {"family": "Sumiya", "given": "Mariya Kibtiya", "initials": "MK"}, {"family": "Islam", "given": "A K M Monwarul", "initials": "AKMM"}, {"family": "Uddin", "given": "Mir Jamal", "initials": "MJ"}, {"family": "MacIntyre", "given": "C Raina", "initials": "CR"}, {"family": "Cajander", "given": "Sara", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Frobert", "given": "Ole", "initials": "O"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-04-00", "journal": {"title": "Open Heart", "issn": "2053-3624", "volume": "8", "issue": "1", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "We aimed to determine the prevalence and outcome of occult infection with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza in patients presenting with myocardial infarction (MI) without COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nWe conducted an observational study from 28 June to 11 August 2020, enrolling patients admitted to the National Institute of Cardiovascular Disease Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh, with ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) or non-ST-segment elevation MI who did not meet WHO criteria for suspected COVID-19.

We evaluated the hypothesis that a larger impact from the first wave (February-March 2020) predicts a smaller peak during the second wave (September-October), in the absence of local changes in public health interventions and area-specific differences in time trends of environmental parameters. Based on publicly available data on province-specific SARS-CoV-2 infections and both crude and multivariable cubic spline regression models, we found that for provinces with the lowest incidence rates in the first wave, the incidence in the second wave increased roughly in proportion with the incidence in the first wave until an incidence of about 500-600 cases/100,000 in the first wave. Above that value, provinces with higher incidences in the first wave experienced lower incidences in the second wave. It appears that a comparatively high cumulative incidence of infection, even if far below theoretical thresholds required for herd immunity, may provide noticeable protection during the second wave. We speculate that, if real, the mechanism for this pattern could be depletion of most susceptible individuals and of superspreaders in the first wave. A population learning effect regarding cautious behavior could have also contributed. Since no area-specific variation of the national policy against the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was allowed until early November 2020, neither individual behaviours nor established or purported environmental risk factors of Covid-19, such as air pollution and meteorological factors, are likely to have confounded the inverse trends we observed in infection incidence over time.", "doi": "10.1016/j.envres.2021.111097", "pmid": "33811866", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Public Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0013-9351(21)00391-1"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-04-06T10:11:10.599Z", "modified": "2021-04-06T10:11:10.610Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "c398d42342914c1eb3002464917db1eb", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/c398d42342914c1eb3002464917db1eb.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/c398d42342914c1eb3002464917db1eb"}}, "title": "Second wave mortality among patients hospitalised for COVID-19 in Sweden: a nationwide observational cohort study", "authors": [{"family": "Str\u00e5lin", "given": "Kristoffer", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Wahlstr\u00f6m", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Walther", "given": "Sten", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Bennet-Bark", "given": "Anna M", "initials": "AM"}, {"family": "Heurgren", "given": "Mona", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Lind\u00e9n", "given": "Thomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Holm", "given": "Johanna", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Hanberger", "given": "H\u00e5kan", "initials": "H"}], "type": "posted-content", "published": "2021-03-31", "journal": {"title": "medRxiv", "issn": null, "issn-l": null, "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1101/2021.03.29.21254557", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Type: Preprint": null, "Category: Health": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-04-15T19:04:27.671Z", "modified": "2021-05-17T19:21:05.917Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "bc41bcd6a843474c8beee260d5a0ed27", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/bc41bcd6a843474c8beee260d5a0ed27.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/bc41bcd6a843474c8beee260d5a0ed27"}}, "title": "Household food insecurity and its association with self-reported male perpetration of intimate partner violence: a survey of two districts in central and western Uganda.", "authors": [{"family": "Awungafac", "given": "George", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Mugamba", "given": "Stephen", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Nalugoda", "given": "Fred", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Sj\u00f6land", "given": "Carl Fredrik", "initials": "CF"}, {"family": "Kigozi", "given": "Godfrey", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Rautiainen", "given": "Susanne", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Malyabe", "given": "Robert Bulamba", "initials": "RB"}, {"family": "Ziegel", "given": "Leo", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Nakigozi", "given": "Gertrude", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Nalwoga", "given": "Grace Kigozi", "initials": "GK"}, {"family": "Kyasanku", "given": "Emmanuel", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Nkale", "given": "James", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Watya", "given": "Stephen", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Ekstr\u00f6m", "given": "Anna Mia", "initials": "AM"}, {"family": "K\u00e5gesten", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-03-31", "journal": {"title": "BMJ Open", "issn": "2044-6055", "volume": "11", "issue": "3", "pages": "e045427", "issn-l": "2044-6055"}, "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the lifetime prevalence of male-perpetrated intimate partner violence (IPV), and to assess the association with food insecurity, sociodemographic factors and health risk behaviours in Uganda in the year preceding COVID-19-associated lockdowns.\n\nPopulation-based, cross-sectional household survey.\n\nUrban, semiurban and rural communities of the Wakiso and Hoima districts in Uganda.\n\nA total of N=2014 males aged 13-80 years participated in the survey.

Performing a Propensity Score Matching based on gender and tumor stage, the effect of treatment on seropositivity was analyzed through a regression logistic model and the ICIs treatment resulted to be the only protective factor significantly (p = 0.03) associated with positivity (odds ratio-OR: 0.41; 95% confidence interval-CI 0.18-0.91). According to these preliminary data, ICIs would appear to be a protective factor against the onset of COVID-19 infection.", "doi": "10.1186/s12967-021-02798-2", "pmid": "33789686", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1186/s12967-021-02798-2"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC8010485"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-04-06T10:44:34.189Z", "modified": "2021-04-06T10:45:15.550Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "9951948df6af47d19567e1e5335019c5", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/9951948df6af47d19567e1e5335019c5.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/9951948df6af47d19567e1e5335019c5"}}, "title": "Report from the CVOT Summit 2020: new cardiovascular and renal outcomes.", "authors": [{"family": "Schnell", "given": "Oliver", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Cos", "given": "Xavier", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "Cosentino", "given": "Francesco", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Forst", "given": "Thomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Giorgino", "given": "Francesco", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Heersprink", "given": "Hiddo J L", "initials": "HJL"}, {"family": "Kosiborod", "given": "Mikhail", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Wanner", "given": "Christoph", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Standl", "given": "Eberhard", "initials": "E"}], "type": "editorial", "published": "2021-03-31", "journal": {"title": "Cardiovasc Diabetol", "issn": "1475-2840", "volume": "20", "issue": "1", "pages": "75", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "The 6th Cardiovascular Outcome Trial (CVOT) Summit \"Cardiovascular and Renal Outcomes 2020\" was the first to be held virtually on October 29-30, 2020.

We aimed to examine the link between vitamin D supplementation and prevention of ARIs in an updated meta-analysis.\n\nFor this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry for studies listed from database inception to May 1, 2020. Double-blind RCTs of vitamin D 3, vitamin D2, or 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) supplementation for any duration, with a placebo or low-dose vitamin D control, were eligible if they had been approved by a research ethics committee, and if ARI incidence was collected prospectively and prespecified as an efficacy outcome. Studies reporting results of long-term follow-up of primary RCTs were excluded. Aggregated study-level data, stratified by baseline 25(OH)D concentration and age, were obtained from study authors. Using the proportion of participants in each trial who had one or more ARIs, we did a random-effects meta-analysis to obtain pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs to estimate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of having one or more ARIs (primary outcome) compared with placebo. Subgroup analyses were done to estimate whether the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of ARI varied according to baseline 25(OH)D concentration (<25 nmol/L vs 25\u00b70-49\u00b79 nmol/L vs 50\u00b70-74\u00b79 nmol/L vs >75\u00b70 nmol/L), vitamin D dose (daily equivalent of <400 international units [IU] vs 400-1000 IU vs 1001-2000 IU vs >2000 IU), dosing frequency (daily vs weekly vs once per month to once every 3 months), trial duration (\u226412 months vs >12 months), age at enrolment (<1\u00b700 years vs 1\u00b700-15\u00b799 years vs 16\u00b700-64\u00b799 years vs \u226565\u00b700 years), and presence versus absence of airway disease (ie, asthma only, COPD only, or unrestricted). Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool. The study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020190633.\n\nWe identified 1528 articles, of which 46 RCTs (75 541 participants) were eligible. Data for the primary outcome were obtained for 48 488 (98\u00b71%) of 49 419 participants (aged 0-95 years) in 43 studies. A significantly lower proportion of participants in the vitamin D supplementation group had one or more ARIs (14 332 [61\u00b73%] of 23 364 participants) than in the placebo group (14 217 [62\u00b73%] of 22 802 participants), with an OR of 0\u00b792 (95% CI 0\u00b786-0\u00b799; 37 studies; I 2=35\u00b76%, pheterogeneity=0\u00b7018). No significant effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of having one or more ARIs was observed for any of the subgroups defined by baseline 25(OH)D concentration. However, protective effects of supplementation were observed in trials in which vitamin D was given in a daily dosing regimen (OR 0\u00b778 [95% CI 0\u00b765-0\u00b794]; 19 studies; I2=53\u00b75%, pheterogeneity=0\u00b7003), at daily dose equivalents of 400-1000 IU (0\u00b770 [0\u00b755-0\u00b789]; ten studies; I2=31\u00b72%, pheterogeneity=0\u00b716), for a duration of 12 months or less (0\u00b782 [0\u00b772-0\u00b793]; 29 studies; I2=38\u00b71%, pheterogeneity=0\u00b7021), and to participants aged 1\u00b700-15\u00b799 years at enrolment (0\u00b771 [0\u00b757-0\u00b790]; 15 studies; I2=46\u00b70%, pheterogeneity=0\u00b7027). No significant interaction between allocation to the vitamin D supplementation group versus the placebo group and dose, dose frequency, study duration, or age was observed. In addition, no significant difference in the proportion of participants who had at least one serious adverse event in the vitamin supplementation group compared with the placebo group was observed (0\u00b797 [0\u00b786-1\u00b707]; 36 studies; I2=0\u00b70%, pheterogeneity=0\u00b799). Risk of bias within individual studies was assessed as being low for all but three trials.\n\nDespite evidence of significant heterogeneity across trials, vitamin D supplementation was safe and overall reduced the risk of ARI compared with placebo, although the risk reduction was small. Protection was associated with administration of daily doses of 400-1000 IU for up to 12 months, and age at enrolment of 1\u00b700-15\u00b799 years. The relevance of these findings to COVID-19 is not known and requires further investigation.\n\nNone.", "doi": "10.1016/S2213-8587(21)00051-6", "pmid": "33798465", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S2213-8587(21)00051-6"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-04-06T10:40:59.319Z", "modified": "2021-04-06T10:40:59.341Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "41e5af559a954cca92916b7c5903d08f", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/41e5af559a954cca92916b7c5903d08f.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/41e5af559a954cca92916b7c5903d08f"}}, "title": "Digital social entrepreneurship: the N-Helix response to stakeholders' COVID-19 needs.", "authors": [{"family": "Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez", "given": "Mar\u00eda J", "initials": "MJ"}, {"family": "Guerrero", "given": "Maribel", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Y\u00e1\u00f1ez-Vald\u00e9s", "given": "Claudia", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Barros-Celume", "given": "Sebasti\u00e1n", "initials": "S"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-03-30", "journal": {"title": "J Technol Transf", "issn": "0892-9912", "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": "1-24", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "This study explores the emergence of a new entrepreneurship phenomenon (digital social entrepreneurship) as a result of the collaboration among many agents (N-Helix), given the government's limited capacity to respond to the stakeholders' needs satisfaction related to an exogenous event (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic).

We have conducted a scoping review focused on sexual health (excluding reproductive health (RH), intimate partner violence (IPV) and gender-based violence (GBV)) in the COVID-19 era, examining sexual behaviours and sexual health outcomes.\n\nA scoping review, compiling both peer-reviewed and grey literature, focused on sexual health (excluding RH, IPV and GBV) and COVID-19 was conducted on 15 September 2020. Multiple bibliographical databases were searched. Study selection conformed to Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Reviewers' Manual 2015 Methodology for JBI Scoping Reviews. We only included English-language original studies.\n\nWe found that men who have sex with men may be moving back toward pre-pandemic levels of sexual activity, and that STI and HIV testing rates seem to have decreased. There was minimal focus on outcomes such as the economic impact on sexual health (excluding RH, IPV and GBV) and STI care, especially STI care of marginalised populations. In terms of population groups, there was limited focus on sex workers or on women, especially women's sexual behaviour and mental health. We noticed limited use of qualitative techniques. Very few studies were in low/middle-income countries (LMICs).\n\nSexual health research is critical during a global infectious disease pandemic and our review of studies suggested notable research gaps.

Even in settings with established antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes, there were weaknesses exposed regarding appropriate antibiotic use in the context of the pandemic. Moreover, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance and AMS have been deprioritised with diversion of health system resources to the pandemic response. This experience highlights deficiencies in AMR containment and mitigation strategies that require urgent attention from clinical and scientific communities. These include the need to implement diagnostic stewardship to assess the global incidence of coinfections and secondary infections in COVID-19 patients, including those by multidrug-resistant pathogens, to identify patients most likely to benefit from antibiotic treatment and identify when antibiotics can be safely withheld, de-escalated or discontinued. Long-term global surveillance of clinical and societal antibiotic use and resistance trends is required to prepare for subsequent changes in AMR epidemiology, while ensuring uninterrupted supply chains and preventing drug shortages and stock outs. These interventions present implementation challenges in resource-constrained settings, making a case for implementation research on AMR.

Two female community-based cohorts (18-44 years) provided longitudinal (smartphone application, N = 1,170,315, n = 79 pregnant tested positive) and cross-sectional (web-based survey, N = 1,344,966, n = 134 pregnant tested positive) data, prospectively collected through self-participatory citizen surveillance in UK, Sweden and USA. Pregnant and non-pregnant were compared for frequencies of events, including SARS-CoV-2 testing, symptoms and hospitalization rates. Multivariable regression was used to investigate symptoms severity and comorbidity effects. Pregnant and non-pregnant women positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were not different in syndromic severity, except for gastrointestinal symptoms. Pregnant were more likely to have received testing, despite reporting fewer symptoms. Pre-existing lung disease was most closely associated with syndromic severity in pregnant hospitalized. Heart and kidney diseases and diabetes increased risk. The most frequent symptoms among non-hospitalized women were anosmia [63% pregnant, 92% non-pregnant] and headache [72%, 62%]. Cardiopulmonary symptoms, including persistent cough [80%] and chest pain [73%], were more frequent among pregnant who were hospitalized.

but also its glycosylation machinery, and to a variable extent cover viral surface proteins with tolerogenic host-like structures. SARS-CoV-2 surface protein S presents as a trimer on the viral surface and is covered by a dense shield of N-linked glycans, and a few O-glycosites have been reported. The location of O-glycans is controlled by a large family of initiating enzymes with variable expression in cells and tissues and hence is difficult to predict. Here, we used our well-established O-glycoproteomic workflows to map the precise positions of O-linked glycosylation sites on three different entities of protein S-insect cell or human cell-produced ectodomains, or insect cell derived receptor binding domain (RBD). In total 25 O-glycosites were identified, with similar patterns in the two ectodomains of different cell origin, and a distinct pattern of the monomeric RBD. Strikingly, 16 out of 25 O-glycosites were located within three amino acids from known N-glycosites. However, O-glycosylation was primarily found on peptides that were unoccupied by N-glycans, and otherwise had low overall occupancy. This suggests possible complementary functions of O-glycans in immune shielding and negligible effects of O-glycosylation on subunit vaccine design for SARS-CoV-2.", "doi": "10.3390/v13040551", "pmid": "33806155", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Biochemistry": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "v13040551"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-04-06T10:35:44.200Z", "modified": "2021-04-06T10:35:44.209Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "dc56fd4c0afb439f9a943617cb5b418a", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/dc56fd4c0afb439f9a943617cb5b418a.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/dc56fd4c0afb439f9a943617cb5b418a"}}, "title": "Factors Associated with Emerging and Re-emerging of SARS-CoV-2 Variants", "authors": [{"family": "Spratt", "given": "Austin N", "initials": "AN"}, {"family": "Kannan", "given": "Saathvik R", "initials": "SR"}, {"family": "Woods", "given": "Lucas T", "initials": "LT"}, {"family": "Weisman", "given": "Gary A", "initials": "GA"}, {"family": "Quinn", "given": "Thomas P", "initials": "TP"}, {"family": "Lorson", "given": "Christian L", "initials": "CL"}, {"family": "S\u00f6nnerborg", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Byrareddy", "given": "Siddappa N", "initials": "SN"}, {"family": "Singh", "given": "Kamal", "initials": "K"}], "type": "posted-content", "published": "2021-03-24", "journal": {"title": "bioRxiv", "issn": null, "issn-l": null, "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1101/2021.03.24.436850", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Type: Preprint": null, "Category: Biochemistry": null, "Category: Genomics & transcriptomics": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-04-15T18:53:24.322Z", "modified": "2021-04-21T08:36:57.929Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "ce949ddad1b34d3cba35a5f617b4f1bf", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/ce949ddad1b34d3cba35a5f617b4f1bf.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/ce949ddad1b34d3cba35a5f617b4f1bf"}}, "title": "Diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants preceded the initial COVID-19 outbreak in Croatia.", "authors": [{"family": "Roki\u0107", "given": "Filip", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Trgovec-Greif", "given": "Lovro", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Su\u010di\u0107", "given": "Neven", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "\u010cemelji\u0107", "given": "Noa", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Grbe\u0161a", "given": "\u0110ur\u0111ica Cekinovi\u0107", "initials": "\u0110C"}, {"family": "Svedru\u017ei\u0107", "given": "\u017deljko", "initials": "\u017d"}, {"family": "Rukavina", "given": "Tomislav", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Vugrek", "given": "Oliver", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Jurak", "given": "Igor", "initials": "I"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-03-24", "journal": {"title": "Arch Virol", "issn": "1432-8798", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "We developed a next-generation SARS-CoV-2 sequencing platform and obtained the first SARS-CoV-2 sequences from patients in Croatia at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in the spring of 2020.

The impacts of lockdown policies on joint surgeries are unknown. Therefore, we assessed the effects of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown restrictions on the number of emergency and elective hip joint surgeries, and explored whether these procedures are more/less affected by lockdown restrictions than other hospital care.Patients and methods - In 1,344,355 persons aged \u2265 35 years in the Norwegian emergency preparedness (BEREDT C19) register, we studied the daily number of persons having (1) emergency surgeries due to hip fractures, and (2) electively planned surgeries due to hip osteoarthritis before and after COVID-19 lockdown restrictions were implemented nationally on March 13, 2020, for different age and sex groups. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) reflect the after-lockdown number of surgeries divided by the before-lockdown number of surgeries.Results - After-lockdown elective hip surgeries comprised one-third the number of before-lockdown (IRR \u223c0.3), which is a greater drop than that seen in all-cause elective hospital care (IRR \u223c0.6). Men aged 35-69 had half the number of emergency hip fracture surgeries (IRR \u223c0.6), whereas women aged \u2265 70 had the same number of emergency hip fracture surgeries after lockdown (IRR \u223c1). Only women aged 35-69 and men aged \u2265 70 had emergency hip fracture surgery rates after lockdown comparable to what may be expected based on analyses of all-cause acute care (IRR \u223c0.80)Interpretation - It is important to note for future pandemics management that lockdown restrictions may impact more on scheduled joint surgery than other scheduled hospital care. Lockdown may also impact the number of emergency joint surgeries for men aged \u2265 35 but not those for women aged \u2265 70.", "doi": "10.1080/17453674.2021.1898782", "pmid": "33757405", "labels":

Neighborhood greenness levels were quantified by using the average normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) within 50 m, 100 m, 300 m, and 500 m buffers surrounding the participant's place of residence. We found that the number of individuals that reported that they visited natural areas \"often\" was significantly higher during the pandemic than before the pandemic. Higher levels of greenness surrounding one's location of residence were in general associated with higher mental health/well-being and vitality scores, and less symptoms of depression, anxiety, and perceived and cognitive stress, after adjustments for demographic variables and walkability.

Here we identify a hitherto unknown role of CX3CR1 in Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway mediated repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) in replicating cells. FA pathway activation triggers CX3CR1 nuclear localization which facilitates assembly of the key FA protein FANCD2 into foci. Interfering with CX3CR1 function upon ICL-induction results in inability of replicating cells to progress from S phase, replication fork stalling and impaired chromatin recruitment of key FA pathway factors. Consistent with defective FA repair, CX3CR1i results in increased levels of residual cisplatin-DNA adducts and decreased cell survival. Importantly, CX3CR1i synergizes with platinum agents in a nonreversible manner in proliferation assays including platinum resistant models.

The Drivers of COVID-19 Vaccination Acceptance Scale (DrVac-COVID19S) was recently developed to help healthcare professionals and researchers better understand vaccination acceptance. The present study examined whether DrVac-COVID19S is measurement invariant across different subgroups (Taiwanese vs. mainland Chinese university students; males vs. females; and health-related program majors vs. non-health-related program majors). Taiwanese ( n = 761; mean age = 25.51 years; standard deviation (SD) = 6.42; 63.5% females) and mainland Chinese university students (n = 3145; mean age = 20.72 years; SD = 2.06; 50.2% females) were recruited using an online survey between 5 January and 21 February 2021.

Multigroup CFA showed that FCV-19S was partially invariant across country and fully invariant across gender and age. DIF findings were consistent with the findings from multigroup CFA. Many DIF items were displayed for country, few DIF items were displayed for age, and no DIF items were displayed for gender.\n\nBased on the results of the present study, the FCV-19S is a good psychometric instrument to assess fear of COVID-19 during the pandemic period.

The governments of affected countries have implemented various measures to limit the spread of the virus. The starting point of this paper is the different government approaches, in terms of promulgating new legislative regulations to limit the virus diffusion and to contain negative effects on the populations.\n\nThe objective of this paper is to study how the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is linked to the government policies, and to analyse how different policies have produced different results on public health.\n\nConsidering the official data provided by 4 countries (Italy, Germany, Sweden and Brazil) and from the measures implemented by their respective governments, we built an Agent-Based Model (ABM) to study the effects that these measures will have over time on different variables such as the total number of COVID-19 cases, intensive care unit (ICU) bed occupancy rates, and recovery and case fatality rates. The model we implemented provides for the possibility of modifying some starting variables, and it was thus possible to study the effects that some policies (such as keeping the national borders closed or the increase in ICU beds) would have had on the spread of the infection.\n\nThe 4 considered countries have adopted different containment measures for SARS-CoV-2, and the forecasts provided by the model for the considered variables have given different results. Italy and Germany seem to be able to limit the spread of the infection and any eventual \"second wave\", while Sweden and Brazil do not seem to have the situation under control. This situation is reflected also in the forecasts of pressure on the National Health Services, which see Sweden and Brazil with a high occupancy rate of ICU beds also in the coming months, with a consequent high number of deaths.\n\nIn line with what we expected, the obtained results show that the countries that have taken very restrictive measures in terms of limiting the mobility of the population have managed, more successfully than others, to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the model demonstrates that herd immunity cannot be reached even in countries which have relied on a strategy without strict containment measures.\n\nNot Applicable.", "doi": "10.2196/24192", "pmid": "33750735", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Other": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-03-24T06:57:45.986Z", "modified": "2021-03-24T06:57:57.046Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "eb5532c9c30840e7ae31b631e10eb2ac", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/eb5532c9c30840e7ae31b631e10eb2ac.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/eb5532c9c30840e7ae31b631e10eb2ac"}}, "title": "Blood neurofilament light concentration at admittance: a potential prognostic marker in COVID-19.", "authors": [{"family": "Aamodt", "given": "Anne Hege", "initials": "AH"}, {"family": "H\u00f8gest\u00f8l", "given": "Einar August", "initials": "EA"}, {"family": "Popperud", "given": "Trine Haug", "initials": "TH"}, {"family": "Holter", "given": "Jan Cato", "initials": "JC"}, {"family": "Dyrhol-Riise", "given": "Anne Ma", "initials": "AM"}, {"family": "Tonby", "given": "Kristian", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Stiksrud", "given": "Birgitte", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Quist-Paulsen", "given": "Else", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Berge", "given": "Tone", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Barratt-Due", "given": "Andreas", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Aukrust", "given": "P\u00e5l", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Heggelund", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Blennow", "given": "Kaj", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Zetterberg", "given": "Henrik", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Harbo", "given": "Hanne Flinstad", "initials": "HF"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-03-20", "journal": {"title": "J Neurol", "issn": "1432-1459", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "To test the hypotheses that blood biomarkers for nervous system injury, serum concentrations of neurofilament light chain protein (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp) can serve as biomarkers for disease severity in COVID-19 patients.\n\nForty-seven inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 had blood samples drawn on admission for assessing serum biomarkers of CNS injury by Single molecule array (Simoa), NfL and GFAp.

There is currently no biomarker or model for in utero microglial priming and function that might aid in identifying the neonates and children most vulnerable to neurodevelopmental morbidity, as microglia remain inaccessible in fetal life and after birth. This study aimed to generate patient-derived microglial-like cell models unique to each neonate from reprogrammed umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells, adapting and extending a novel methodology previously validated for adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We demonstrate that umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells can be used to create microglial-like cell models morphologically and functionally similar to microglia observed in vivo. We illustrate the application of this approach by generating microglia from cells exposed and unexposed to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection.

To date, there are many contact tracing apps that have already been launched and used in 2020. There has been a lot of speculations about the privacy and security aspects of these apps and their potential violation of data protection principles. Therefore, the developers of these apps are constantly criticized because of undermining users' privacy, neglecting essential privacy and security requirements, and developing apps under time pressure without considering privacy- and security-by-design. In this study, we analyze the privacy and security performance of 28 contact tracing apps available on Android platform from various perspectives, including their code's privileges, promises made in their privacy policies, and static and dynamic performances. Our methodology is based on the collection of various types of data concerning these 28 apps, namely permission requests, privacy policy texts, run-time resource accesses, and existing security vulnerabilities. Based on the analysis of these data, we quantify and assess the impact of these apps on users' privacy. We aimed at providing a quick and systematic inspection of the earliest contact tracing apps that have been deployed on multiple continents. Our findings have revealed that the developers of these apps need to take more cautionary steps to ensure code quality and to address security and privacy vulnerabilities.

This study explores the proteomic differences between mild, severe, and critical COVID-19 positive patients to further understand the disease progression, identify proteins associated with disease severity, and identify potential therapeutic targets. Blood protein profiling was performed on 59 COVID-19 mild (n = 26), severe (n = 9) or critical (n = 24) cases and 28 controls using the OLINK inflammation, autoimmune, cardiovascular and neurology panels. Differential expression analysis was performed within and between disease groups to generate nine different analyses.

In 2020, as part of Denmark's extensive, free-of-charge PCR-testing strategy, approximately 4 million individuals (69% of the population) underwent 10\u00b76 million tests. Using these national PCR-test data from 2020, we estimated protection towards repeat infection with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIn this population-level observational study, we collected individual-level data on patients who had been tested in Denmark in 2020 from the Danish Microbiology Database and analysed infection rates during the second surge of the COVID-19 epidemic, from Sept 1 to Dec 31, 2020, by comparison of infection rates between individuals with positive and negative PCR tests during the first surge (March to May, 2020). For the main analysis, we excluded people who tested positive for the first time between the two surges and those who died before the second surge. We did an alternative cohort analysis, in which we compared infection rates throughout the year between those with and without a previous confirmed infection at least 3 months earlier, irrespective of date. We also investigated whether differences were found by age group, sex, and time since infection in the alternative cohort analysis. We calculated rate ratios (RRs) adjusted for potential confounders and estimated protection against repeat infection as 1 - RR.\n\nDuring the first surge (ie, before June, 2020), 533 381 people were tested, of whom 11 727 (2\u00b720%) were PCR positive, and 525 339 were eligible for follow-up in the second surge, of whom 11 068 (2\u00b711%) had tested positive during the first surge. Among eligible PCR-positive individuals from the first surge of the epidemic, 72 (0\u00b765% [95% CI 0\u00b751-0\u00b782]) tested positive again during the second surge compared with 16 819 (3\u00b727% [3\u00b722-3\u00b732]) of 514 271 who tested negative during the first surge (adjusted RR 0\u00b7195 [95% CI 0\u00b7155-0\u00b7246]). Protection against repeat infection was 80\u00b75% (95% CI 75\u00b74-84\u00b75). The alternative cohort analysis gave similar estimates (adjusted RR 0\u00b7212 [0\u00b7179-0\u00b7251], estimated protection 78\u00b78% [74\u00b79-82\u00b71]). In the alternative cohort analysis, among those aged 65 years and older, observed protection against repeat infection was 47\u00b71% (95% CI 24\u00b77-62\u00b78). We found no difference in estimated protection against repeat infection by sex (male 78\u00b74% [72\u00b71-83\u00b72] vs female 79\u00b71% [73\u00b79-83\u00b73]) or evidence of waning protection over time (3-6 months of follow-up 79\u00b73% [74\u00b74-83\u00b73] vs \u22657 months of follow-up 77\u00b77% [70\u00b79-82\u00b79]).\n\nOur findings could inform decisions on which groups should be vaccinated and advocate for vaccination of previously infected individuals because natural protection, especially among older people, cannot be relied on.\n\nNone.", "doi": "10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00575-4", "pmid": "33743221", "labels": {"Category: Public Health": null, "Category: Health": null, "Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0140-6736(21)00575-4"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-03-22T10:13:10.682Z", "modified": "2021-03-22T10:13:10.692Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "bcf96a7cfc6548a3b5054f75641dca84", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/bcf96a7cfc6548a3b5054f75641dca84.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/bcf96a7cfc6548a3b5054f75641dca84"}}, "title": "Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on utilisation of healthcare services: a systematic review.", "authors": [{"family": "Moynihan", "given": "Ray", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Sanders", "given": "Sharon", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Michaleff", "given": "Zoe A", "initials": "ZA"}, {"family": "Scott", "given": "Anna Mae", "initials": "AM"}, {"family": "Clark", "given": "Justin", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "To", "given": "Emma J", "initials": "EJ"}, {"family": "Jones", "given": "Mark", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Kitchener", "given": "Eliza", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Fox", "given": "Melissa", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Johansson", "given": "Minna", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Lang", "given": "Eddy", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Duggan", "given": "Anne", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Scott", "given": "Ian", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Albarqouni", "given": "Loai", "initials": "L"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-03-16", "journal": {"title": "BMJ Open", "issn": "2044-6055", "volume": "11", "issue": "3", "pages": "e045343", "issn-l": "2044-6055"}, "abstract": "To determine the extent and nature of changes in utilisation of healthcare services during COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSystematic review.\n\nEligible studies compared utilisation of services during COVID-19 pandemic to at least one comparable period in prior years.

Two scenarios with different ventilation rates were compared, as well as adult female versus male recipients.

Awake proning is an attractive intervention in settings with limited resources, as it comes with no additional costs. However, awake proning remains poorly used probably because of unfamiliarity and uncertainties regarding potential benefits and practical application. To summarize evidence for benefit and to develop a set of pragmatic recommendations for awake proning in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, focusing on settings where resources are limited, international healthcare professionals from high and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) with known expertise in awake proning were invited to contribute expert advice. A growing number of observational studies describe the effects of awake proning in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in whom hypoxemia is refractory to simple measures of supplementary oxygen. Awake proning improves oxygenation in most patients, usually within minutes, and reduces dyspnea and work of breathing. The effects are maintained for up to 1 hour after turning back to supine, and mostly disappear after 6-12 hours. In available studies, awake proning was not associated with a reduction in the rate of intubation for invasive ventilation. Awake proning comes with little complications if properly implemented and monitored. Pragmatic recommendations including indications and contraindications were formulated and adjusted for resource-limited settings. Awake proning, an adjunctive treatment for hypoxemia refractory to supplemental oxygen, seems safe in non-intubated patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory failure. We provide pragmatic recommendations including indications and contraindications for the use of awake proning in LMICs.", "doi": "10.4269/ajtmh.20-1445", "pmid": "33705348", "labels": {"Category: Health": null, "Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "tpmd201445"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-03-12T07:05:39.237Z", "modified": "2021-03-12T07:05:39.249Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "de451ac94d164bf5b45bf034a5c04d1c", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/de451ac94d164bf5b45bf034a5c04d1c.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/de451ac94d164bf5b45bf034a5c04d1c"}}, "title": "Metabolomic analyses of COVID-19 patients unravel stage-dependent and prognostic biomarkers.", "authors": [{"family": "Danlos", "given": "Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier", "initials": "FX"}, {"family": "Grajeda-Iglesias", "given": "Claudia", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Durand", "given": "Sylv\u00e8re", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Sauvat", "given": "Allan", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Roumier", "given": "Mathilde", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Cantin", "given": "Delphine", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Colomba", "given": "Emeline", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Rohmer", "given": "Julien", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Pommeret", "given": "Fanny", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Baciarello", "given": "Giulia", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Willekens", "given": "Christophe", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Vasse", "given": "Marc", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Griscelli", "given": "Frank", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Fahrner", "given": "Jean-Eudes", "initials": "JE"}, {"family": "Goubet", "given": "Anne-Ga\u00eblle", "initials": "AG"}, {"family": "Dubuisson", "given": "Agathe", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Derosa", "given": "Lisa", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Nirmalathasan", "given": "Nitharsshini", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Bredel", "given": "Delphine", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Mouraud", "given": "S\u00e9verine", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Pradon", "given": "Caroline", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Stoclin", "given": "Annabelle", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Rozenberg", "given": "Flore", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Duchemin", "given": "J\u00e9r\u00f4me", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Jourdi", "given": "Georges", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Ellouze", "given": "Syrine", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Levavasseur", "given": "Fran\u00e7oise", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Albig\u00e8s", "given": "Laurence", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Soria", "given": "Jean-Charles", "initials": "JC"}, {"family": "Barlesi", "given": "Fabrice", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Solary", "given": "Eric", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Andr\u00e9", "given": "Fabrice", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "P\u00e8ne", "given": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Ackerman", "given": "F\u00e9lix", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Mouthon", "given": "Luc", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Zitvogel", "given": "Laurence", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Marabelle", "given": "Aur\u00e9lien", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Michot", "given": "Jean-Marie", "initials": "JM"}, {"family": "Fontenay", "given": "Michaela", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Kroemer", "given": "Guido", "initials": "G"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-03-11", "journal": {"title": "Cell Death Dis", "issn": "2041-4889", "volume": "12", "issue": "3", "pages": "258", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "The circulating metabolome provides a snapshot of the physiological state of the organism responding to pathogenic challenges.

This analysis revealed major disease- and stage-associated shifts in the metabolome, meaning that at least 77 metabolites including amino acids, lipids, polyamines and sugars, as well as their derivatives, were altered in critical COVID-19 patient's plasma as compared to mild COVID-19 patients.

Effective treatments of COVID-19 are urgently needed. This is the second edition of a living systematic review of randomized clinical trials assessing the effects of all treatment interventions for participants in all age groups with COVID-19.\n\nWe planned to conduct aggregate data meta-analyses, trial sequential analyses, network meta-analysis, and individual patient data meta-analyses. Our systematic review was based on PRISMA and Cochrane guidelines, and our eight-step procedure for better validation of clinical significance of meta-analysis results. We performed both fixed-effect and random-effects meta-analyses. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were admission to intensive care, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, quality of life, and non-serious adverse events. According to the number of outcome comparisons, we adjusted our threshold for significance to p = 0.033. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. We searched relevant databases and websites for published and unpublished trials until November 2, 2020. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial methodology. We included 82 randomized clinical trials enrolling a total of 40,249 participants. 81 out of 82 trials were at overall high risk of bias. Meta-analyses showed no evidence of a difference between corticosteroids versus control on all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR] 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79 to 1.00; p = 0.05; I2 = 23.1%; eight trials; very low certainty), on serious adverse events (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.80 to 0.99; p = 0.04; I2 = 39.1%; eight trials; very low certainty), and on mechanical ventilation (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.55 to 1.33; p = 0.49; I2 = 55.3%; two trials; very low certainty). The fixed-effect meta-analyses showed indications of beneficial effects. Trial sequential analyses showed that the required information size for all three analyses was not reached. Meta-analysis (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.07; p = 0.31; I2 = 0%; four trials; moderate certainty) and trial sequential analysis (boundary for futility crossed) showed that we could reject that remdesivir versus control reduced the risk of death by 20%. Meta-analysis (RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.68 to 1.00; p = 0.05; I2 = 38.9%; four trials; very low certainty) and trial sequential analysis (required information size not reached) showed no evidence of difference between remdesivir versus control on serious adverse events. Fixed-effect meta-analysis showed indications of a beneficial effect of remdesivir on serious adverse events. Meta-analysis (RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.87; p = 0.02; I2 = 0%; two trials; very low certainty) showed evidence of a beneficial effect of intravenous immunoglobulin versus control on all-cause mortality, but trial sequential analysis (required information size not reached) showed that the result was severely underpowered to confirm or reject realistic intervention effects. Meta-analysis (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.35 to 1.14; p = 0.12; I2 = 77.4%; five trials; very low certainty) and trial sequential analysis (required information size not reached) showed no evidence of a difference between tocilizumab versus control on serious adverse events. Fixed-effect meta-analysis showed indications of a beneficial effect of tocilizumab on serious adverse events. Meta-analysis (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.96; p = 0.02; I2 = 0%; three trials; very low certainty) showed evidence of a beneficial effect of tocilizumab versus control on mechanical ventilation, but trial sequential analysis (required information size not reached) showed that the result was severely underpowered to confirm of reject realistic intervention effects. Meta-analysis (RR 0.32; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.69; p < 0.00; I2 = 0%; two trials; very low certainty) showed evidence of a beneficial effect of bromhexine versus standard care on non-serious adverse events, but trial sequential analysis (required information size not reached) showed that the result was severely underpowered to confirm or reject realistic intervention effects. Meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses (boundary for futility crossed) showed that we could reject that hydroxychloroquine versus control reduced the risk of death and serious adverse events by 20%. Meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses (boundary for futility crossed) showed that we could reject that lopinavir-ritonavir versus control reduced the risk of death, serious adverse events, and mechanical ventilation by 20%. All remaining outcome comparisons showed that we did not have enough information to confirm or reject realistic intervention effects. Nine single trials showed statistically significant results on our outcomes, but were underpowered to confirm or reject realistic intervention effects. Due to lack of data, it was not relevant to perform network meta-analysis or possible to perform individual patient data meta-analyses.\n\nNo evidence-based treatment for COVID-19 currently exists. Very low certainty evidence indicates that corticosteroids might reduce the risk of death, serious adverse events, and mechanical ventilation; that remdesivir might reduce the risk of serious adverse events; that intravenous immunoglobin might reduce the risk of death and serious adverse events; that tocilizumab might reduce the risk of serious adverse events and mechanical ventilation; and that bromhexine might reduce the risk of non-serious adverse events. More trials with low risks of bias and random errors are urgently needed. This review will continuously inform best practice in treatment and clinical research of COVID-19.\n\nPROSPERO CRD42020178787.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0248132", "pmid": "33705495", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PONE-D-20-38879"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-03-12T07:06:25.255Z", "modified": "2021-03-12T07:06:25.266Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "7d04c0dd10e84d5a812d21d4b41b5fd2", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7d04c0dd10e84d5a812d21d4b41b5fd2.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7d04c0dd10e84d5a812d21d4b41b5fd2"}}, "title": "Global Tuberculosis Report 2020 - Reflections on the Global TB burden, treatment and prevention efforts.", "authors": [{"family": "Chakaya", "given": "Jeremiah", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Khan", "given": "Mishal", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Ntoumi", "given": "Francine", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Aklillu", "given": "Eleni", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Razia", "given": "Fatima", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Mwaba", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Kapata", "given": "Nathan", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Mfinanga", "given": "Sayoki", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Hasnain", "given": "Seyed Ehtesham", "initials": "SE"}, {"family": "Katoto", "given": "Patrick Dmc", "initials": "PD"}, {"family": "Bulabula", "given": "Andr\u00e9 N H", "initials": "ANH"}, {"family": "Sam-Agudu", "given": "Nadia A", "initials": "NA"}, {"family": "Nachega", "given": "Jean B", "initials": "JB"}, {"family": "Tiberi", "given": "Simon", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "McHugh", "given": "Timothy D", "initials": "TD"}, {"family": "Abubakar", "given": "Ibrahim", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Zumla", "given": "Alimuddin", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-03-11", "journal": {"title": "Int J Infect Dis", "issn": "1878-3511", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": "1201-9712"}, "abstract": "The October 2020 Global TB report reviews TB control strategies and United Nations (UN) targets set in the political declaration at the September 2018 UN General Assembly high-level meeting on TB held in New York. Progress in TB care and prevention has been very slow. In 2019, TB remained the most common cause of death from a single infectious pathogen. Globally, an estimated 10.0 million people developed TB disease in 2019, and there were an estimated 1.2 million TB deaths among HIV-negative people and an additional 208, 000 deaths among people living with HIV. Adults accounted for 88% and children for 12% of people with TB. The WHO regions of South-East Asia (44%), Africa (25%), and the Western Pacific (18%) had the most people with TB. Eight countries accounted for two thirds of the global total: India (26%), Indonesia (8.5%), China (8.4%), the Philippines (6.0%), Pakistan (5.7%), Nigeria (4.4%), Bangladesh (3.6%) and South Africa (3.6%). Only 30% of the 3.5 million five-year target for children treated for TB was met. Major advances have been development of new all oral regimens for MDRTB and new regimens for preventive therapy. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic dislodged TB from the top infectious disease cause of mortality globally. Notably, global TB control efforts were not on track even before the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many challenges remain to improve sub-optimal TB treatment and prevention services. Tuberculosis screening and diagnostic test services need to be ramped up. The major drivers of TB remain undernutrition, poverty, diabetes, tobacco smoking, and household air pollution and these need be addressed to achieve the WHO 2035 TB care and prevention targets. National programs need to include interventions for post-tuberculosis holistic wellbeing. From first detection of COVID-19 global coordination and political will with huge financial investments have led to the development of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV2 infection.

We previously built fully glycosylated full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein models in a viral membrane including both open and closed conformations of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and different templates for the stalk region. In this work, multiple \u03bcs-long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were performed to provide deeper insights into the structure and dynamics of S protein and glycan functions. Our simulations reveal that the highly flexible stalk is composed of two independent joints and most probable S protein orientations are competent for ACE2 binding. We identify multiple glycans stabilizing the open and/or closed states of the RBD and demonstrate that the exposure of antibody epitopes can be captured by detailed antibody-glycan clash analysis instead of commonly used accessible surface area analysis that tends to overestimate the impact of glycan shielding and neglect possible detailed interactions between glycan and antibodies.

However, numerous uncertainties exist regarding the pros and cons of vaccination, especially in patients with (immune-mediated) kidney diseases on immunosuppressive drugs. Here, members of the Immunonephrology Working Group (IWG) of the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) discuss thirteen frequently-asked questions regarding safety and efficacy of the most promising vaccine candidates. Post-marketing surveillance should be performed to estimate the rate of vaccine response (humoral and cellular) of different vaccine platforms, and surveillance of disease activity following administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Some of the candidates induce signaling pathways which also promote autoimmune kidney diseases, e.g. type I interferons in systemic lupus erythematosus. Efficacy estimates would thus far favor the use of selected COVID-19 vaccines, such as BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 or Gam-COVID-Vac. Humoral immune response after vaccination should be monitored using appropriate assays. Even in the absence of neutralizing antibodies patients might be protected by a sufficient cellular immune response capable to reduce severity of COVID-19. A reduced vaccine response after the use of CD20-depleting agents is anticipated, and it is particularly important to discuss strategies to improve vaccine response with these patients. Distancing and shielding measures remain important as not all vaccines fully protect from coronavirus infection.

Despite access to oxygen and pharmacologic/nonpharmacologic therapies in hospitals, symptom relief in dying nursing home residents acutely admitted to hospitals was lower compared with those who died in nursing homes, possibly because of differences in patient characteristics.Conclusion:", "doi": "10.1089/jpm.2020.0688", "pmid": "33667124", "labels": {"Category: Health": null, "Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-03-06T10:08:49.786Z", "modified": "2021-03-06T10:09:43.786Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "a044efb1677249b29be6bbb0a662f825", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/a044efb1677249b29be6bbb0a662f825.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/a044efb1677249b29be6bbb0a662f825"}}, "title": "A chronicle of SARS-CoV-2: Seasonality, environmental fate, transport, inactivation, and antiviral drug resistance.", "authors": [{"family": "Kumar", "given": "Manish", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Mazumder", "given": "Payal", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Mohapatra", "given": "Sanjeeb", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Kumar Thakur", "given": "Alok", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Dhangar", "given": "Kiran", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Taki", "given": "Kaling", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Mukherjee", "given": "Santanu", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Kumar Patel", "given": "Arbind", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Bhattacharya", "given": "Prosun", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Mohapatra", "given": "Pranab", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Rinklebe", "given": "J\u00f6rg", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Kitajima", "given": "Masaaki", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Hai", "given": "Faisal I", "initials": "FI"}, {"family": "Khursheed", "given": "Anwar", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Furumai", "given": "Hiroaki", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Sonne", "given": "Christian", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Kuroda", "given": "Keisuke", "initials": "K"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-03-05", "journal": {"title": "J Hazard Mater", "issn": "1873-3336", "volume": "405", "issue": null, "pages": "124043", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "In this review, we present the environmental perspectives of the viruses and antiviral drugs related to SARS-CoV-2. The present review paper discusses occurrence, fate, transport, susceptibility, and inactivation mechanisms of viruses in the environment as well as environmental occurrence and fate of antiviral drugs, and prospects (prevalence and occurrence) of antiviral drug resistance (both antiviral drug resistant viruses and antiviral resistance in the human). During winter, the number of viral disease cases and environmental occurrence of antiviral drug surge due to various biotic and abiotic factors such as transmission pathways, human behaviour, susceptibility, and immunity as well as cold climatic conditions. Adsorption and persistence critically determine the fate and transport of viruses in the environment. Inactivation and disinfection of virus include UV, alcohol, and other chemical-base methods but the susceptibility of virus against these methods varies. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are major reserviors of antiviral drugs and their metabolites and transformation products. Ecotoxicity of antiviral drug residues against aquatic organisms have been reported, however more threatening is the development of antiviral resistance, both in humans and in wild animal reservoirs. In particular, emergence of antiviral drug-resistant viruses via exposure of wild animals to high loads of antiviral residues during the current pandemic needs further evaluation.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.124043", "pmid": "33268203", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0304-3894(20)32033-1"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7536132"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-02-10T18:52:29.712Z", "modified": "2021-02-10T18:53:14.080Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "9e8e161c43634d88b5d5a60fdaa4cbd5", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/9e8e161c43634d88b5d5a60fdaa4cbd5.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/9e8e161c43634d88b5d5a60fdaa4cbd5"}}, "title": "Understanding COVID-19 through adverse outcome pathways - 2nd CIAO AOP Design Workshop.", "authors": [{"family": "Wittwehr", "given": "Clemens", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Amorim", "given": "Maria Jo\u00e3o", "initials": "MJ"}, {"family": "Clerbaux", "given": "Laure-Alix", "initials": "LA"}, {"family": "Krebs", "given": "Catharine", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Landesmann", "given": "Brigitte", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Macmillan", "given": "Donna", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Nymark", "given": "Penny", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Ram", "given": "Rebecca", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Garcia-Reyero", "given": "Nat\u00e0lia", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Sachana", "given": "Magdalini", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Sullivan", "given": "Kristie", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Sund", "given": "Jukka", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Willett", "given": "Catharine", "initials": "C"}], "type": "editorial", "published": "2021-03-05", "journal": {"title": "ALTEX", "issn": "1868-596X", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "The CIAO project (Modelling the Pathogenesis of COVID\u201119 using the Adverse Outcome Pathway framework) aims at a holistic assembly of knowledge to deliver a truly transdisciplinary description of the entire COVID\u201119 physiopathology starting with the initial contact with the SARS\u2011CoV\u201119 virus and ending with one or several adverse outcomes, e.g., respiratory failure.

It expands visualizations to multiple datasets for quality control, statistical comparisons and overlap and correlation analyses, while allowing for rapid inspection and downloading of selected features. The usage of OmicLoupe is demonstrated in three different studies, where it allowed for detection of both technical data limitations and biological trends across different omic layers.

However, entry mediated by these proteases was blocked by Camostat mesylate. The Camostat metabolite GBPA inhibited recombinant TMPRSS2 with reduced efficiency as compared to Camostat mesylate. In contrast, both inhibitors exhibited similar antiviral activity and this correlated with the rapid conversion of Camostat mesylate into GBPA in the presence of serum. Finally, Camostat mesylate and GBPA blocked SARS-CoV-2 spread in human lung tissue ex vivo and the related protease inhibitor Nafamostat mesylate exerted augmented antiviral activity.\n\nOur results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can use TMPRSS2 and closely related proteases for spread in the upper respiratory tract and that spread in the human lung can be blocked by Camostat mesylate and its metabolite GBPA.\n\nNIH, Damon Runyon Foundation, ACS, NYCT, DFG, EU, Berlin Mathematics center MATH+, BMBF, Lower Saxony, Lundbeck Foundation, Novo Nordisk Foundation.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ebiom.2021.103255", "pmid": "33676899", "labels": {"Category: Biochemistry": null, "Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S2352-3964(21)00048-7"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-03-09T06:29:35.329Z", "modified": "2021-03-09T06:29:35.339Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "66c7514e2642441da18b49f672fd2839", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/66c7514e2642441da18b49f672fd2839.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/66c7514e2642441da18b49f672fd2839"}}, "title": "Seroprevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among health care workers from three pandemic hospitals of Turkey.", "authors": [{"family": "Alkurt", "given": "Gizem", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Murt", "given": "Ahmet", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Aydin", "given": "Zeki", "initials": "Z"}, {"family": "Tatli", "given": "Ozge", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Agaoglu", "given": "Nihat Bugra", "initials": "NB"}, {"family": "Irvem", "given": "Arzu", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Aydin", "given": "Mehtap", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Karaali", "given": "Ridvan", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Gunes", "given": "Mustafa", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Yesilyurt", "given": "Batuhan", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Turkez", "given": "Hasan", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Mardinoglu", "given": "Adil", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Doganay", "given": "Mehmet", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Basinoglu", "given": "Filiz", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Seyahi", "given": "Nurhan", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Dinler Doganay", "given": "Gizem", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Doganay", "given": "Hamdi Levent", "initials": "HL"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-03-03", "journal": {"title": "PLoS One", "issn": "1932-6203", "volume": "16", "issue": "3", "pages": "e0247865", "issn-l": "1932-6203"}, "abstract": "COVID-19 is a global threat with an increasing number of infections.

This allows for a comparison of parents and teachers differently exposed to open and closed schools, but otherwise facing similar conditions. Leveraging rich Swedish register data, we connect all students and teachers in Sweden to their families and study the impact of moving to online instruction on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. We find that, among parents, exposure to open rather than closed schools resulted in a small increase in PCR-confirmed infections (odds ratio [OR] 1.17; 95% CI [CI95] 1.03 to 1.32). Among lower-secondary teachers, the infection rate doubled relative to upper-secondary teachers (OR 2.01; CI95 1.52 to 2.67). This spilled over to the partners of lower-secondary teachers, who had a higher infection rate than their upper-secondary counterparts (OR 1.29; CI95 1.00 to 1.67). When analyzing COVID-19 diagnoses from healthcare visits and the incidence of severe health outcomes, results are similar for teachers, but weaker for parents and teachers' partners.

Of those invited, 98/160 (61%) responded, of whom 94/98 (96%) completed the survey. Respondents rated overall care highly (mean 4.7/5) and 89/94 (95%) reported that they would recommend the hospital to friends and/or family. Most respondents felt safe on the ward (94%), with privacy maintained (93%) and pain well managed (90%). Fewer than two-thirds (63%) of respondents considered themselves adequately consulted regarding medications and side effects.

We described events by PHA, number of contacts and exposure context.ResultsThe RKI processed 467 events, initiating contact to PHA 1,099 times (median = 1; interquartile range (IQR): 1-2) and sharing data on 5,099 contact persons. Of 327 (70%) events with known exposure context, the most commonly reported exposures were aircraft (n = 64; 20%), cruise ships (n = 24; 7%) and non-transport contexts (n = 210; 64%). Cruise ship and aircraft exposures generated more contacts with authorities (median = 10; IQR: 2-16, median = 4; IQR: 2-11) and more contact persons (median = 60; IQR: 9-269, median = 2; IQR: 1-3) than non-transport exposures (median = 1; IQR: 1-6 and median = 1; IQR: 1-2). The median time spent on contact tracing was highest for cruise ships: 5 days (IQR: 3-9).ConclusionIn the COVID-19 pandemic, cross-border contact tracing is considered a critical component of the outbreak response. While only a minority of international contact tracing activities were related to exposure events in transport, they contributed substantially to the workload.

While several governments have imposed a nationwide total or partial lockdown to slow down the spread of the virus, the Swedish government has opted for a recommendation-based approach together with a few imposed restrictions. In a previous contribution by the authors, the impact of the Swedish strategy was observed through the monitored variation of the city noise levels during a period associated with the so-called \"first wave\" of the pandemic in Stockholm. A very strong impact of these recommendations was shown on the evolution of the noise levels in central Stockholm. This highlighted the potential of acoustic sensor networks both for enforcement of regulation and monitoring of the effectiveness of their implementation. The present contribution presents a follow-up to this urban noise monitoring in central Stockholm, Sweden, for the period leading to the so-called \"second wave\" of the pandemic in Europe. Both the evolution of adherence to the recommendations and the impact of the recurrence of cases combined with reinforced recommendations are observed through the evolution of the measured noise levels. While the measurements show a gradual lower level of compliance, in particular, past the summer break, these also show again a rapid response to the reinforced recommendations issued by the authorities in mid-fall of 2020. These observations thus confirm the potential associated with detailed urban noise monitoring, for instance here acting as a proxy to evaluating the response to recommendations or restrictions in times of crisis.", "doi": "10.1121/10.0003778", "pmid": "33765773", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Other": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-03-29T09:15:50.369Z", "modified": "2021-03-29T09:15:50.385Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "5a5780c724224d5eb0b814962d3ac220", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/5a5780c724224d5eb0b814962d3ac220.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/5a5780c724224d5eb0b814962d3ac220"}}, "title": "Symptom clusters in COVID-19: A potential clinical prediction tool from the COVID Symptom Study app.", "authors": [{"family": "Sudre", "given": "Carole H", "initials": "CH"}, {"family": "Lee", "given": "Karla A", "initials": "KA"}, {"family": "Lochlainn", "given": "Mary Ni", "initials": "MN"}, {"family": "Varsavsky", "given": "Thomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Murray", "given": "Benjamin", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Graham", "given": "Mark S", "initials": "MS"}, {"family": "Menni", "given": "Cristina", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Modat", "given": "Marc", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Bowyer", "given": "Ruth C E", "initials": "RCE"}, {"family": "Nguyen", "given": "Long H", "initials": "LH"}, {"family": "Drew", "given": "David A", "initials": "DA"}, {"family": "Joshi", "given": "Amit D", "initials": "AD"}, {"family": "Ma", "given": "Wenjie", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Guo", "given": "Chuan-Guo", "initials": "CG"}, {"family": "Lo", "given": "Chun-Han", "initials": "CH"}, {"family": "Ganesh", "given": "Sajaysurya", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Buwe", "given": "Abubakar", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Pujol", "given": "Joan Capdevila", "initials": "JC"}, {"family": "du Cadet", "given": "Julien Lavigne", "initials": "JL"}, {"family": "Visconti", "given": "Alessia", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Freidin", "given": "Maxim B", "initials": "MB"}, {"family": "El-Sayed Moustafa", "given": "Julia S", "initials": "JS"}, {"family": "Falchi", "given": "Mario", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Davies", "given": "Richard", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Gomez", "given": "Maria F", "initials": "MF"}, {"family": "Fall", "given": "Tove", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Cardoso", "given": "M Jorge", "initials": "MJ"}, {"family": "Wolf", "given": "Jonathan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Franks", "given": "Paul W", "initials": "PW"}, {"family": "Chan", "given": "Andrew T", "initials": "AT"}, {"family": "Spector", "given": "Tim D", "initials": "TD"}, {"family": "Steves", "given": "Claire J", "initials": "CJ"}, {"family": "Ourselin", "given": "S\u00e9bastien", "initials": "S"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-03-00", "journal": {"title": "Sci Adv", "issn": "2375-2548", "volume": "7", "issue": "12", "issn-l": "2375-2548"}, "abstract": "As no one symptom can predict disease severity or the need for dedicated medical support in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we asked whether documenting symptom time series over the first few days informs outcome.

Their epidemiology and effect on the spread of emerging coronaviruses has been neglected thus far. We aimed to elucidate the epidemiology and burden of disease of seasonal hCoVs OC43, NL63, and 229E in patients in primary care and hospitals in Belgium between 2015 and 2020.\n\nWe retrospectively analysed data from the national influenza surveillance networks in Belgium during the winter seasons of 2015-20. Respiratory specimens were collected through the severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and the influenza-like illness networks from patients with acute respiratory illness with onset within the previous 10 days, with measured or reported fever of 38\u00b0C or greater, cough, or dyspnoea; and for patients admitted to hospital for at least one night. Potential risk factors were recorded and patients who were admitted to hospital were followed up for the occurrence of complications or death for the length of their hospital stay. All samples were analysed by multiplex quantitative RT-PCRs for respiratory viruses, including seasonal hCoVs OC43, NL63, and 229E. We estimated the prevalence and incidence of seasonal hCoV infection, with or without co-infection with other respiratory viruses. We evaluated the association between co-infections and potential risk factors with complications or death in patients admitted to hospital with seasonal hCoV infections by age group. Samples received from week 8, 2020, were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n2573 primary care and 6494 hospital samples were included in the study. 161 (6\u00b73%) of 2573 patients in primary care and 371 (5\u00b77%) of 6494 patients admitted to hospital were infected with a seasonal hCoV. OC43 was the seasonal hCoV with the highest prevalence across age groups and highest incidence in children admitted to hospital who were younger than 5 years (incidence 9\u00b70 [95% CI 7\u00b72-11\u00b72] per 100 000 person-months) and adults older than 65 years (2\u00b76 [2\u00b71-3\u00b72] per 100 000 person-months). Among 262 patients admitted to hospital with seasonal hCoV infection and with complete information on potential risk factors, 66 (73\u00b73%) of 90 patients who had complications or died also had at least one potential risk factor (p=0\u00b70064). Complications in children younger than 5 years were associated with co-infection (24 [36\u00b74%] of 66; p=0\u00b7017), and in teenagers and adults (\u226515 years), more complications arose in patients with a single hCoV infection (49 [45\u00b70%] of 109; p=0\u00b70097). In early 2020, the Belgian SARI surveillance detected the first SARS-CoV-2-positive sample concomitantly with the first confirmed COVID-19 case with no travel history to China.\n\nThe main burden of severe seasonal hCoV infection lies with children younger than 5 years with co-infections and adults aged 65 years and older with pre-existing comorbidities. These age and patient groups should be targeted for enhanced observation when in medical care and in possible future vaccination strategies, and co-infections in children younger than 5 years should be considered during diagnosis and treatment. Our findings support the use of national influenza surveillance systems for seasonal hCoV monitoring and early detection, and monitoring of emerging coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2.\n\nBelgian Federal Public Service Health, Food Chain Safety, and Environment; Belgian National Insurance Health Care (Institut national d'assurance maladie-invalidit\u00e9/Rijksinstituut voor ziekte-en invaliditeitsverzekering); and Regional Health Authorities (Flanders Agentschap zorg en gezondheid, Brussels Commission communautaire commune, Wallonia Agence pour une vie de qualit\u00e9).", "doi": "10.1016/s2666-5247(20)30221-4", "pmid": "33937883", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Public Health": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-05-04T15:57:48.285Z", "modified": "2021-05-04T15:58:08.069Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "0cc8de28a8744ab880da9073a0059bab", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/0cc8de28a8744ab880da9073a0059bab.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/0cc8de28a8744ab880da9073a0059bab"}}, "title": "AMR research in a post-pandemic world: Insights on antimicrobial resistance research in the COVID-19 pandemic", "authors": [{"family": "Rodr\u00edguez-Ba\u00f1o", "given": "Jes\u00fas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Rossolini", "given": "Gian Maria", "initials": "GM"}, {"family": "Schultsz", "given": "Constance", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Tacconelli", "given": "Evelina", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Murthy", "given": "Srinivas", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Ohmagari", "given": "Norio", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Holmes", "given": "Alison", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Bachmann", "given": "Till", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Goossens", "given": "Herman", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Canton", "given": "Rafael", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Roberts", "given": "Adam P", "initials": "AP"}, {"family": "Henriques-Normark", "given": "Birgitta", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Clancy", "given": "Cornelius J", "initials": "CJ"}, {"family": "Huttner", "given": "Benedikt", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Fagerstedt", "given": "Patriq", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Lahiri", "given": "Shawon", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Kaushic", "given": "Charu", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Hoffman", "given": "Steven J", "initials": "SJ"}, {"family": "Warren", "given": "Margo", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Zoubiane", "given": "Ghada", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Essack", "given": "Sabiha", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Laxminarayan", "given": "Ramanan", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Plant", "given": "Laura", "initials": "L"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2021-03-00", "journal": {"title": "Journal of Global Antimicrobial Resistance", "issn": "2213-7165", "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": null, "issn-l": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jgar.2021.02.013", "pmid": "33662647", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-03-06T10:20:21.390Z", "modified": "2021-03-06T10:22:29.753Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "05093540bf5441dfb79be809471bc698", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/05093540bf5441dfb79be809471bc698.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/05093540bf5441dfb79be809471bc698"}}, "title": "Towards a sensitive and accurate interpretation of molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2: a rapid review of 264 studies.", "authors": [{"family": "Stanoeva", "given": "Kamelia R", "initials": "KR"}, {"family": "van der Eijk", "given": "Annemiek A", "initials": "AA"}, {"family": "Meijer", "given": "Adam", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Kortbeek", "given": "Laetitia M", "initials": "LM"}, {"family": "Koopmans", "given": "Marion P G", "initials": "MPG"}, {"family": "Reusken", "given": "Chantal B E M", "initials": "CBEM"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-03-00", "journal": {"title": "Euro Surveill", "issn": "1560-7917", "volume": "26", "issue": "10", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "BackgroundSensitive molecular diagnostics and correct test interpretation are crucial for accurate COVID-19 diagnosis and thereby essential for good clinical practice.

An anonymous sample of web panel members was assessed, altogether 2029 individuals (52% women, 10% moderate-risk or problem gamblers). Results indicated that 6% reported increased gambling, and 4% reported decreased gambling during the pandemic. Having increased gambling was associated with more severe gambling problems (OR 2.78, 95% confidence interval 2.27-3.40), increased alcohol consumption (OR 2.92, 1.71-4.98), and psychological distress (OR 3.38, 1.83-6.23). In the group reporting increased gambling during COVID-19, moderate-risk/problem gambling was very common (62%). Recent governmental policy interventions in the area were known to a minority (30%) of respondents, but awareness of the regulations was markedly more common in individuals with at least moderate-risk gambling (56%) and in self-excluders (78%). Reporting of any perceived influence from policy changes was low (3%), and divided between those reporting an increasing and decreasing effect, respectively. Increased gambling may be a consequence of COVID-19-related changes in everyday lives of individuals with problematic gambling patterns.

Methods: We performed in silico analyses of immune system protein interactome network, single-cell RNA sequencing of human tissues, and artificial neural networks to reveal potential therapeutic targets for drug repurposing against COVID-19. Results: We screened 1,584 high-confidence immune system proteins in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells, finding 25 potential therapeutic targets significantly overexpressed in nasal goblet secretory cells, lung type II pneumocytes, and ileal absorptive enterocytes of patients with several immunopathologies. Then, we performed fully connected deep neural networks to find the best multitask classification model to predict the activity of 10,672 drugs, obtaining several approved drugs, compounds under investigation, and experimental compounds with the highest area under the receiver operating characteristics. Conclusion: After being effectively analyzed in clinical trials, these drugs can be considered for treatment of severe COVID-19 patients.

Patients were followed until death or study end-point October 22, 2020. Association with patient sex and mortality, in addition to clinical variables, was estimated using Cox regression. We also performed a logistic regression model estimating factors associated with 90-day mortality.\n\nIn total, 2354 patients with COVID-19 were included. Four patients were still in the ICU at study end-point. Median follow-up time was 183 days. Mortality at 90-days was 26.9%, 23.4% in women and 28.2% in men. After 90 days until end of follow-up, only 11 deaths occurred. On multivariable Cox regression analysis, male sex (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.06-1.54) remained significantly associated with mortality even after adjustments. Additionally, age, COPD/asthma, immune deficiency, malignancy, SAPS3 and admission month were associated with mortality. The logistic regression model of 90-day mortality showed almost identical results.\n\nIn this nationwide study of ICU patients with COVID-19, men were at higher risk of poor long-term outcome compared to their female counterparts.

To understand the underlying mechanisms involved in lung pathology, we investigated the role of the lung-specific immune response. We profiled immune cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and blood collected from COVID-19 patients with severe disease and bacterial pneumonia patients not associated with viral infection. By tracking T cell clones across tissues, we identified clonally expanded tissue-resident memory-like Th17 cells (Trm17 cells) in the lungs even after viral clearance. These Trm17 cells were characterized by a a potentially pathogenic cytokine expression profile of IL17A and CSF2 (GM-CSF). Interactome analysis suggests that Trm17 cells can interact with lung macrophages and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, which have been associated with disease severity and lung damage. High IL-17A and GM-CSF protein levels in the serum of COVID-19 patients were associated with a more severe clinical course. Collectively, our study suggests that pulmonary Trm17 cells are one potential orchestrator of the hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19.", "doi": "10.1126/sciimmunol.abf6692", "pmid": "33622974", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Biochemistry": null, "Category: Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "6/56/eabf6692"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-02-25T12:27:16.311Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:45:48.060Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "1587f1507ee34fd9ba0ae982cdb57e9a", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/1587f1507ee34fd9ba0ae982cdb57e9a.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/1587f1507ee34fd9ba0ae982cdb57e9a"}}, "title": "Critical COVID-19 represents an endothelial disease with high similarity to kidney disease on the molecular level", "authors": [{"family": "Siwy", "given": "Justyna", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Wendt", "given": "Ralph", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Albalat", "given": "Amaya", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "He", "given": "Tianlin", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Mischak", "given": "Harald", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Mullen", "given": "William", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Latosinska", "given": "Agnieszka", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Luebbert", "given": "Christoph", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Kalbitz", "given": "Sven", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Mebazaa", "given": "Alexandre", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Peters", "given": "Bjoern", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Stegmayr", "given": "Bernd", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Spasovski", "given": "Goce", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Wiech", "given": "Thorsten", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Staessen", "given": "Jan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Wolf", "given": "Johannes", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Beige", "given": "Joachim", "initials": "J"}], "type": "posted-content", "published": "2021-02-23", "journal": {"title": "medRxiv", "issn": null, "issn-l": null, "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1101/2021.02.22.21252207", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Type: Preprint": null, "Category: Health": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-02-24T06:19:47.773Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:45:47.876Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "f7f307cb36194462b403a98c216e3d2f", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/f7f307cb36194462b403a98c216e3d2f.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/f7f307cb36194462b403a98c216e3d2f"}}, "title": "Digitalizing a Brief Intervention to Reduce Intrusive Memories of Psychological Trauma: Qualitative Interview Study", "authors": [{"family": "Gamble", "given": "Beau", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Depa", "given": "Katherine", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Holmes", "given": "Emily A", "initials": "EA"}, {"family": "Kanstrup", "given": "Marie", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2021-02-22", "journal": {"title": "JMIR Ment Health", "issn": "2368-7959", "volume": "8", "issue": "2", "pages": "e23712", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.2196/23712", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Public Health": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-02-23T07:12:28.728Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:47:00.316Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "59c5edd4606e4ff6b9b1f5c02df9ffb5", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/59c5edd4606e4ff6b9b1f5c02df9ffb5.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/59c5edd4606e4ff6b9b1f5c02df9ffb5"}}, "title": "Indirect Immunofluorescence for Detecting Anti-Neuronal Autoimmunity in CSF after COVID-19 -

The intravascular innate immune system (IIIS), including the complement, contact, coagulation, and fibrinolysis systems, which is crucial for recognizing and eliminating microorganisms and debris in the body, is likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 ARDS. Biomarkers for IIIS activation were studied in the first 66 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU in Uppsala University Hospital, both cross-sectionally on day 1 and in 19 patients longitudinally for up to a month, in a prospective study. IIIS analyses were compared with biochemical parameters and clinical outcome and survival. Blood cascade systems activation leading to an overreactive conjunct thromboinflammation was demonstrated, reflected in consumption of individual cascade system components, e.g., FXII, prekallikrein, and high molecular weight kininogen and in increased levels of activation products, e.g., C4d, C3a, C3d,g, sC5b-9, TAT, and D-dimer. Strong associations were found between the blood cascade systems and organ damage, illness severity scores, and survival. We show that critically ill COVID-19 patients display a conjunct activation of the IIIS that is linked to organ damage of the lung, heart, kidneys, and death. We present evidence that the complement and in particular the kallikrein/kinin system is strongly activated and that both systems are prognostic markers of the outcome of the patients suggesting their role in driving the inflammation.

The RCT will be conducted in six European countries in the context of the Horizon 2020 European funded research and innovation project \"Psychosocial support for promoting mental health and well-being among adolescent young caregivers in Europe\" (\"ME-WE\"). The ME-WE intervention is based on Hayes and Ciarrochi's psychoeducational model for adolescents and will consist of seven 2-h sessions in a group format, aimed to help AYCs build psychological flexibility and live according to their values. The control group will be a waitlist. Primary and secondary outcomes and control variables will be measured at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1) and 3 months follow-up (T2). The COVID-19 pandemic has made amendments necessary to the original study protocol methodology, which we describe in detail. This study will contribute to building an evidence-based manualized program that educators and health and social care professionals can use to support AYCs in their transition to adulthood. From a research perspective, the outcomes of this study will contribute to evidence-based practices in primary prevention of psychosocial difficulties in AYCs and will gather novel knowledge on the effectiveness of Hayes and Ciarrochi's model for use with middle adolescents with caring responsibilities.

The answers to these questions lie within typical government technocracy versus Sweden's constitutional separation of government and technocracy. We review the history of the responses to the pandemic and show how the \"tyranny of experts\" was severe within the typical technocratic policy response, and attenuated in Sweden's. Thus, the recent pandemic offers empirical evidence and insights regarding the role of Hayekian knowledge problems in engendering a technocratic \"tyranny of experts\" and how such effects can be structurally mitigated.", "doi": "10.1002/soej.12493", "pmid": "33821054", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Public Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "SOEJ12493"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC8014802"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-04-07T10:11:20.636Z", "modified": "2021-04-07T10:11:49.163Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "a7817eb57bdf490c9e490c19a8dabe4f", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/a7817eb57bdf490c9e490c19a8dabe4f.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/a7817eb57bdf490c9e490c19a8dabe4f"}}, "title": "Different disease, same challenges: Social determinants of tuberculosis and COVID-19.", "authors": [{"family": "Duarte", "given": "R", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Aguiar", "given": "A", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Pinto", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Furtado", "given": "I", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Tiberi", "given": "S", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "L\u00f6nnroth", "given": "K", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Migliori", "given": "G B", "initials": "GB"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-02-19", "journal": {"title": "Pulmonology", "issn": "2531-0437", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis (TB) and the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) relate to environmental factors, understanding of which is essential to inform policy and practice and tackle them effectively.

This article draws on quantitative data collected by the GeoPoll, and, from these data, assesses the effect of concern about the local spread and economic impact of COVID-19 on food worries. Qualitative data comprising 12 countries south of the Sahara reveal that lockdowns have created anxiety over food security as a health, economic and human rights/well-being issue. By applying a probit model, we find that concern about the local spread of COVID-19 and economic impact of the virus increases the probability of food worries. Governments have responded with various efforts to support the neediest.

The case fatality rate varies for different strains of the virus, as do the effects on total mortality.

In this work, disease outbreaks in Sweden, in the time period of 1860-2020, are characterized and compared to the currently ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. The focus is on outbreaks with a sharp increase in all-cause mortality. Outbreak onset is defined as the time point when death counts start to increase consistently for a period of at least 10 days. The duration of the outbreak is defined as the time period in which mortality rates are elevated. Excess mortality is estimated by standard methods. In total there were 15 outbreaks detected in the time period, the first 14 were likely caused by influenza virus infections, the last by SARS-CoV-2. The mortality dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is shown to be similar to outbreaks due to influenza virus, and in terms of the number of excess deaths, it is the worst outbreak in Sweden since the \"Spanish flu\" of 1918-1919.", "doi": "10.3389/fpubh.2021.579948", "pmid": "33681118", "labels": {"Category: Public Health": null, "Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7930003"}, {"db": "URL", "key": "https://github.com/aledberg/outbreaks", "description": "Analysis code and data: daily death counts for Sweden from 1860 to 31.08.2020;

ORs with 95% CIs for associations between severe COVID-19 and exposures with adjustment for confounders were estimated using logistic regression. The median age was 62 years (IQR 52-70), and 3003 (24.9%) were women. Type 2 diabetes (OR, 2.3 (95% CI 1.9 to 2.7)), hypertension (OR, 1.7 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.0)), obesity (OR, 3.1 (95% CI 2.4 to 4.0)) and chronic kidney disease (OR, 2.5 (95% CI 1.7 to 3.7)) were all associated with severe COVID-19. In the younger subgroup (below 57 years), ORs were significantly higher for all cardiometabolic risk factors. The risk associated with type 2 diabetes was higher in women (p=0.001) and in patients with a region of birth outside European Union(EU) (p=0.004).\n\nDiabetes, obesity and hypertension were all independently associated with severe COVID-19 with stronger associations in the younger population. Type 2 diabetes implied a greater risk among women and in non-EU immigrants.

Potentially, the pandemic crisis may result in increased problem gambling, for example, due to COVID-19-related psychological distress, unemployment, and financial difficulties. In addition, the cancellation of sports in early parts of the crisis has been suspected to alter gambling behaviors. Policy makers have called for action and, in some cases, have changed regulations, and media have reported possible increases in treatment seeking. However, research data are hitherto lacking. The present study assessed the treatment uptake at a regional specialized gambling-disorder unit in the healthcare system of Region Sk\u00e5ne, Sweden. Number of patients, treatment contacts, and patterns of rescheduling or cancellations of appointments were quantified for each month, January-December 2020, and compared to corresponding months of 2018 and 2019. Possible trends were analyzed, using an interrupted time-series analysis. Results did not indicate an increase in treatment uptake for gambling disorder during the months of COVID-19 impact in Sweden. The proportion of digital treatment increased, but total treatment uptake was unaffected by the pandemic. In conclusion, during the first ten months of the pandemic in Sweden, no obvious increase in treatment uptake for gambling disorder could be seen. Moreover, longer follow-up may be necessary in order to see if effects of worsening socioeconomic conditions may be a possible long-term risk factor of increased gambling after COVID-19.", "doi": "10.3390/ijerph18041918", "pmid": "33671210", "labels": {"Category: Public Health": null, "Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "ijerph18041918"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-03-08T10:55:33.867Z", "modified": "2021-03-08T10:55:33.879Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "4b0f1b1ea560426c8ef9e4bb44326d3f", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/4b0f1b1ea560426c8ef9e4bb44326d3f.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/4b0f1b1ea560426c8ef9e4bb44326d3f"}}, "title": "Extracorporeal Life Support in COVID-19-related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome - a EuroELSO international survey.", "authors": [{"family": "Mang", "given": "Sebastian", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Kalenka", "given": "Armin", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Broman", "given": "Lars Mikael", "initials": "LM"}, {"family": "Supady", "given": "Alexander", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Swol", "given": "Justyna", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Danziger", "given": "Guy", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Becker", "given": "Andr\u00e9", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "H\u00f6rsch", "given": "Sabrina I", "initials": "SI"}, {"family": "Mertke", "given": "Thilo", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Kaiser", "given": "Ralf", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Bracht", "given": "Hendrik", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Zotzmann", "given": "Viviane", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Seiler", "given": "Frederik", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Bals", "given": "Robert", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Taccone", "given": "Fabio Silvio", "initials": "FS"}, {"family": "Moerer", "given": "Onnen", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Lorusso", "given": "Roberto", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "B\u011blohl\u00e1vek", "given": "Jan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Muellenbach", "given": "Ralf M", "initials": "RM"}, {"family": "Lepper", "given": "Philipp M", "initials": "PM"}, {"family": "COVEC-Study Group", "given": "", "initials": ""}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-02-16", "journal": {"title": "Artif Organs", "issn": "1525-1594", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is a means to support patients with acute respiratory failure. Initially, recommendations to treat severe cases of pandemic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) with ECLS have been restrained. In the meantime, ECLS has been shown to produce similar outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19 compared to existing data on ARDS mortality.\n\nWe performed an international email survey to assess how ECLS providers worldwide have previously used ECLS during the treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19.\n\nA questionnaire with 45 questions (covering e.g. indication, technical aspects, benefit and reasons for treatment discontinuation), mostly multiple-choice, was distributed by email to ECLS centers. The survey was approved by the European branch of the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO).\n\n276 ECMO professionals from 98 centers in 30 different countries on four continents reported that they employed ECMO for very severe COVID-19 cases, mostly in veno-venous configuration (87%). The most common reason to establish ECLS was isolated hypoxemic respiratory failure (50%), followed by a combination of hypoxemia and hypercapnia (39%). Only a small fraction of patients required veno-arterial cannulation due to heart failure (3%). Time on ECLS varied between less than two and more than four weeks. The main reason to discontinue ECLS treatment prior to patient's recovery was lack of clinical improvement (53%), followed by major bleeding, mostly intracranially (13%). Only 4% of respondents reported that triage situations, lack of staff or lack of oxygenators were responsible for discontinuation of ECLS support. Most ECLS physicians (51%, IQR 30%) agreed that patients with COVID-19 induced ARDS (CARDS) benefitted from ECLS. Overall mortality of COVID-19 patients on ECLS was estimated to be about 55%.\n\nECLS has been utilized successfully during the COVID-19 pandemic to stabilize CARDS patients in hypoxemic or hypercapnic lung failure. Age and multimorbidity limited the use of ECLS. Triage situations were rarely a concern. ECLS providers stated that patients with severe COVID-19 benefitted from ECLS.", "doi": "10.1111/aor.13940", "pmid": "33590542", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null,

We will use hurdle-negative binomial models to estimate the mean number of days alive without life support in each group and present results as mean differences and incidence rate ratios with 95% credibility intervals (CrIs). Additional count outcomes will be analysed similarly and binary outcomes will be analysed using logistic regression models with results presented as probabilities, relative risks and risk differences with 95% CrIs. We will present probabilities of any benefit/harm, clinically important benefit/harm and probabilities of effects smaller than pre-defined clinically minimally important differences for all outcomes analysed. Analyses will be adjusted for stratification variables and conducted using weakly informative priors supplemented by sensitivity analyses using sceptic priors.\n\nThis secondary, pre-planned Bayesian analysis will supplement the primary, conventional analysis and may help clinicians, researchers and policymakers interpret the results of the COVID STEROID 2 trial while avoiding arbitrarily dichotomised interpretations of the results.", "doi": "10.1111/aas.13793", "pmid": "33583027", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Health": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-02-15T07:51:08.706Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:45:47.914Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "be233521a08a4dd8a582810f62e9423d", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/be233521a08a4dd8a582810f62e9423d.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/be233521a08a4dd8a582810f62e9423d"}}, "title": "High amounts of SARS-CoV-2 precede sickness among asymptomatic healthcare workers", "authors": [{"family": "Dillner", "given": "Joakim", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Elfstr\u00f6m", "given": "K Miriam", "initials": "KM"}, {"family": "Blomqvist", "given": "Jonas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Engstrand", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Uhl\u00e9n", "given": "Mathias", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Eklund", "given": "Carina", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Boulund", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Lagheden", "given": "Camilla", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Hamsten", "given": "Marica", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Nordqvist-Kleppe", "given": "Sara", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Seifert", "given": "Maike", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Hellstr\u00f6m", "given": "Cecilia", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Olofsson", "given": "Jennie", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "Eni", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Falk", "given": "August Jernbom", "initials": "AJ"}, {"family": "Bergstr\u00f6m", "given": "Sofia", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Hultin", "given": "Emilie", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Pin", "given": "Elisa", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Pimenoff", "given": "Ville N", "initials": "VN"}, {"family": "Hassan", "given": "Sadaf", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "M\u00e5nberg", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Hedhammar", "given": "My", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Hober", "given": "Sophia", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Mattsson", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "M\u00fchr", "given": "Laila Sara Arroyo", "initials": "LSA"}, {"family": "Lundgren", "given": "Kalle Conneryd", "initials": "KC"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2021-02-13", "journal": {"title": "The Journal of Infectious Diseases", "issn": "0022-1899", "issn-l": null, "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": null}, "abstract": "Whether SARS-CoV-2 positivity among symptomatic subjects reflects past or future disease may be difficult to ascertain.\n\nWe tested a cohort of 9449 employees at work at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies, linked the testing results to sick leave records and determined associations with past or future sick leave using multinomial logistic regression.

Method: A postal survey was sent in June 2020 to 859 participants from the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER), an ongoing longitudinal study. The survey was developed to assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and related infection-control measures on daily life, specifically commitment to distancing measures, access to health care and social services, daily activities, and changes in cognitive and social activities. Results: By September 2020, 613 (71%) participants responded (mean age = 77.7 years, 32% lived alone, and 80% had at least one chronic condition). Three quarters adopted some distancing practices during the first months of the pandemic. Older participants were more likely to practice total isolation than younger ones (29 vs. 19%; p = 0.003). Non-acute health-care visits were canceled for 5% of the participants who needed appointments, but cancellations in dental health care (43%), home aid (30%), and rehabilitative services (53%) were more common. Pandemic-related changes were reported in social engagements, for example, less contact with friends (55%) and family (31%), or less frequent attendance in cultural events (38%) or associations (25%), although remote contact with others increased for 40%. Feelings of loneliness increased for 21%, particularly those who were older (p = 0.023) or living alone (p < 0.001). Physical activity reduced for 34%, but dietary habits remained stable or improved. Pandemic-related changes in lifestyle and activities were more evident among those living alone. Conclusions: Finnish older persons generally reported less negative changes in lifestyles and behaviors during the pandemic than expected. Older people and those living alone seemed more susceptible to negative changes. It is important to compare how coping strategies may compare with other European countries to identify factors that may help older individuals to maintain healthy lifestyles during future waves of COVID-19.", "doi": "10.3389/fpsyt.2021.624125", "pmid": "33643095", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Public Health": null, "Funder: VR": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7907420"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-03-02T06:52:05.714Z", "modified": "2021-03-02T06:52:05.717Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "2e8684b503454348aaab5858f9790222", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/2e8684b503454348aaab5858f9790222.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/2e8684b503454348aaab5858f9790222"}}, "title": "Quantifying the preventive effect of wearing face masks", "authors": [{"family": "Britton", "given": "Tom", "initials": "T"}], "type": "posted-content", "published": "2021-02-12", "journal": {"title": "medRxiv", "issn": null, "issn-l": null, "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1101/2021.02.09.21251448", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Type: Preprint": null, "Funder: NordForsk": null, "Category: Health": null, "Category: Other": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-02-15T18:30:28.164Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:46:13.012Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "d1d6dd596f3249b8bac66ef8ae32e8ec", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/d1d6dd596f3249b8bac66ef8ae32e8ec.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/d1d6dd596f3249b8bac66ef8ae32e8ec"}}, "title": "Tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in commonly used laboratory cell lines and their proteomic landscape during infection", "authors": [{"family": "Elisa Saccon", "given": "", "initials": ""}, {"family": "Xi Chen", "given": ".", "initials": "."}, {"family": "Flora Mikaeloff", "given": "", "initials": ""}, {"family": "jimmy Esneider Rodriguez", "given": "", "initials": ""}, {"family": "Laszlo Szekely", "given": "", "initials": ""}, {"family": "Beatriz S\u00e1 Vinhas", "given": "", "initials": ""}, {"family": "shuba Krishnan", "given": "", "initials": ""}, {"family": "Siddappa N.

There have also been scarce case reports where neonates required mechanical ventilation post COVID-19 pregnancies.

Three patients were at the time of admission in gestational week between 21 + 4 and 22 + 5 and treated during their antenatal period; meanwhile, the other two were admitted within 1 week postpartum. All of them were in need of intensive care: one was treated with high flow oxygen therapy, the other four with invasive mechanical ventilation (three with endotracheal intubation and one with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). Age above thirty, overweight, and gestational diabetes are notable factors in the cases presented. At the time of admission, they all presented with symptoms such as fever, cough, and dyspnea. Chest imaging with computer tomography scan was performed in each case and demonstrated multifocal pneumonic infiltrates in all of them, but no pulmonary embolism was confirmed in any. Neither did the echocardiogram indicate any cardiomyopathy. Four of the patients have been discharged from the hospital, with an average of 20 hospital days. One antenatal pregnant woman needed prolonged ECMO therapy; in gestational week 27 + 3, she went into cardiac arrest, resulting in an urgent C-section on maternal indication.

While technical guidance surrounding COVID-19 is available to support APEs, communicating this information has been challenging due to restrictions on travel, face-to-face group meetings and training, imposed from May to August 2020. A digital health platform, upSCALE, that already supports 1,213 APEs and 299 supervisors across three provinces, is being used to support APEs on effective COVID-19 management by delivering COVID-19 sensitive SMS messages, training modules and a COVID-19 KAP survey. The KAP survey, conducted from June 2020 to August 2020, consisted of 10 questions. Of 1,065 active upSCALE APEs, 28% completed the survey. Results indicate that only a small proportion of APEs listed the correct COVID-19 symptoms, transmission routes and appropriate prevention measures (n = (25%), n = (16%) and n = (39%), respectively) specifically included in national health education materials. Misconceptions were mainly related to transmission routes, high risk individuals and asymptomatic patients. 84% said they followed all government prevention guidelines. The results from the KAP survey were used to support the rapid development and deployment of targeted COVID-19 awareness and education materials for the APEs. A follow-up KAP survey is planned for November 2020. Adapting the existing upSCALE platform enabled a better understanding, in real time, of the KAP of APEs around COVID-19 management.

They may augment sensory or vagal nerve discharges to evoke pain and several symptoms of COVID-19, including cough, nasal obstruction, vomiting, diarrhea, and, at least partly, sudden and severe loss of smell and taste. TRPA1 can be activated by reactive oxygen species and may therefore be up-regulated in COVID-19. TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels can be activated by pungent compounds including many nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) (Nrf2)-interacting foods leading to channel desensitization. Interactions between Nrf2-associated nutrients and TRPA1/TRPV1 may be partly responsible for the severity of some of the COVID-19 symptoms.

Owing to the fact that isolation centre, in general, always contained a constant number of 200 COVID-19 patients, the prime objective of the study was to check if several drains carrying RNA of coronavirus are actually getting diluted or accumulated along with the sewage network. Our finding suggested that while the temporal variation of the genetic load decreased in small drains over the span of 50 days, the main sewer exhibited accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Other interesting finding displays that probably distance of sampling location in meters is not likely to have a significant impact on the detected gene concentration, although the quantity of the RNA extracted in the downstream of the drain was higher. These findings are of immense value from the perspective of wastewater surveillance of COVID-19, as they largely imply that we do not need to monitor every wastewater system, and probably major drains monitoring may illustrate the city health. Perhaps, we are reporting the accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material along with the sewer network i.e. from primary to tertiary drains.

A single participant, who kept his tap on throughout the handwashing process, overused approximately 1.7L of water per handwash and 14.9L of water per day. Hand scrubbing with soap keeping the tap on, raised the overuse of water 13-fold during this pandemic compared to the non-pandemic situation which cost an extra 224.95 BDT (2.65$) per day for 1980 participants.

The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Resilience Task Force collaboration set out to investigate well-being in oncology over time since COVID-19.\n\nTwo online anonymous surveys were conducted (survey I: April/May 2020; survey II: July/August 2020). Statistical analyses were performed to examine group differences, associations, and predictors of key outcomes: (i) well-being/distress [expanded Well-being Index (eWBI; 9 items)]; (ii) burnout (1 item from eWBI); (iii) job performance since COVID-19 (JP-CV; 2 items).\n\nResponses from survey I (1520 participants from 101 countries) indicate that COVID-19 is impacting oncology professionals; in particular, 25% of participants indicated being at risk of distress (poor well-being, eWBI \u2265 4), 38% reported feeling burnout, and 66% reported not being able to perform their job compared with the pre-COVID-19 period. Higher JP-CV was associated with better well-being and not feeling burnout (P < 0.01). Differences were seen in well-being and JP-CV between countries (P < 0.001) and were related to country COVID-19 crude mortality rate (P < 0.05). Consistent predictors of well-being, burnout, and JP-CV were psychological resilience and changes to work hours.

We observed that the two DREP constructs were immunogenic in mice inducing both binding and neutralizing antibodies as well as T cell responses. Interestingly, the DREP coding for the unmodified spike turned out to be more potent vaccine candidate, eliciting high titers of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies that were able to efficiently neutralize pseudotyped virus after a single immunization. In addition, both DREP constructs were able to efficiently prime responses that could be boosted with a heterologous spike protein immunization. These data provide important novel insights into SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design using a rapid response DNA vaccine platform.

For this purpose, contact-tracing apps are being proposed for large scale adoption by many countries. A centralized approach, where data sensed by the app are all sent to a nation-wide server, raises concerns about citizens' privacy and needlessly strong digital surveillance, thus alerting us to the need to minimize personal data collection and avoiding location tracking. We advocate the conceptual advantage of a decentralized approach, where both contact and location data are collected exclusively in individual citizens' \"personal data stores\", to be shared separately and selectively (e.g., with a backend system, but possibly also with other citizens), voluntarily, only when the citizen has tested positive for COVID-19, and with a privacy preserving level of granularity. This approach better protects the personal sphere of citizens and affords multiple benefits: it allows for detailed information gathering for infected people in a privacy-preserving fashion; and, in turn this enables both contact tracing, and, the early detection of outbreak hotspots on more finely-granulated geographic scale. The decentralized approach is also scalable to large populations, in that only the data of positive patients need be handled at a central level. Our recommendation is two-fold. First to extend existing decentralized architectures with a light touch, in order to manage the collection of location data locally on the device, and allow the user to share spatio-temporal aggregates-if and when they want and for specific aims-with health authorities, for instance. Second, we favour a longer-term pursuit of realizing a Personal Data Store vision, giving users the opportunity to contribute to collective good in the measure they want, enhancing self-awareness, and cultivating collective efforts for rebuilding society.", "doi": "10.1007/s10676-020-09572-w", "pmid": "33551673", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "9572"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7851322"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-02-10T18:48:38.200Z", "modified": "2021-02-10T18:48:38.209Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "f01c7f0716244665a5ce072be3c80321", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/f01c7f0716244665a5ce072be3c80321.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/f01c7f0716244665a5ce072be3c80321"}}, "title": "Pregnant under the pressure of a pandemic: a large-scale longitudinal survey before and during the COVID-19 outbreak.", "authors": [{"family": "Naurin", "given": "Elin", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Markstedt", "given": "Elias", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Stolle", "given": "Dietlind", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Enstr\u00f6m", "given": "Daniel", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Wallin", "given": "Anton", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Andreasson", "given": "Ingrid", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Attebo", "given": "Birgitta", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Eriksson", "given": "Ottilia", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Martinsson", "given": "Klara", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Elden", "given": "Helen", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Linden", "given": "Karolina", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Sengpiel", "given": "Verena", "initials": "V"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-02-01", "journal": {"title": "Eur J Public Health", "issn": "1464-360X", "volume": "31", "issue": "1", "pages": "7-13", "issn-l": "1101-1262"}, "abstract": "One of the groups that is most vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic is pregnant women.

Rural areas of developing countries pose particular difficulties for developing and implementing effective responses owing to underdeveloped health infrastructure, uneven state capacity for infection control, and endemic poverty. This paper makes the case for the critical role of local governance in coordinating pandemic response by examining how state authorities are attempting to bridge the gap between the need for rapid, vigorous response to the pandemic and local realities in three Indian states - Rajasthan, Odisha, and Kerala. Through a combination of interviews with mid and low-level bureaucrats and a review of policy documents, we show how the urgency of COVID-19 response has galvanized new kinds of cross-sectoral and multi-scalar interaction between administrative units involved in coordinating responses, as local governments have assumed central responsibility in the implementation of disease control and social security mechanisms. Evidence from Kerala in particular suggests that the state's long term investment in democratic local government and arrangements for incorporating women within grassroots state functions (through its Kudumbashree program) has built a high degree of public trust and cooperation with state actors, while local authorities embrace an ethic of care in the implementation of state responses. These observations, from the early months of the pandemic in South Asia, can serve as a foundation for future studies of how existing institutional arrangements and their histories pattern the long-term success of disease control and livelihood support as the pandemic proceeds.

Here I discuss endothelial-epithelial co-operative in vivo-responses producing first-line, humoral innate defense opportunities in human airways. The pseudostratified epithelium of human nasal and tracheobronchial airways are prime sites of exposure and infection by SARS-CoV-2. Just beneath the epithelium runs a profuse systemic microcirculation. Its postcapillary venules respond conspicuously to mucosal challenges with autacoids, allergens, and microbes, and to mere loss of epithelium. By active venular endothelial gap formation, followed by transient yielding of epithelial junctions, non-sieved plasma macromolecules move from the microcirculation to the mucosal surface. Hence, plasma-derived protein cascade systems and antimicrobial peptides would have opportunity to operate jointly on an unperturbed mucosal lining. Similarly, a plasma-derived, dynamic gel protects sites of epithelial sloughing-regeneration. Precision for this indiscriminate humoral molecular response lies in restricted location and well-regulated duration of plasma exudation. Importantly, the endothelial responsiveness of the airway microcirculation differs distinctly from the relatively non-responsive, low-pressure pulmonary microcirculation that non-specifically, almost irreversibly, leaks plasma in life-threatening Covid-19. Observations in humans of infections with rhinovirus, corona virus 229E, and influenza A and B, support a general but individually variable early occurrence of plasma exudation in human infected nasal and tracheobronchial airways. Investigations are warranted to elucidate roles of host- and drug-induced airways plasma exudation in restriction of viral infection and, specifically, whether it contributes to variable disease-responses following exposure to SARS-CoV-2.", "doi": "10.1111/sji.13024", "pmid": "33523532", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-02-04T18:24:22.565Z", "modified": "2021-02-04T18:24:22.587Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "1491b4b81ef944f4b9b00b9235cbd797", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/1491b4b81ef944f4b9b00b9235cbd797.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/1491b4b81ef944f4b9b00b9235cbd797"}}, "title": "Decay of SARS-CoV-2 RNA along the wastewater treatment outfitted with Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) system evaluated through two sample concentration techniques.", "authors": [{"family": "Kumar", "given": "Manish", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Kuroda", "given": "Keisuke", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Patel", "given": "Arbind Kumar", "initials": "AK"}, {"family": "Patel", "given": "Nidhi", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Bhattacharya", "given": "Prosun", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Joshi", "given": "Madhvi", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Joshi", "given": "Chaitanya G", "initials": "CG"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-02-01", "journal": {"title": "Sci Total Environ", "issn": "1879-1026", "issn-l": "0048-9697", "volume": "754", "issue": null, "pages": "142329"}, "abstract": "For the first time, we present, i) an account of decay in the genetic material loading of SARS-CoV-2 during Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) treatment of wastewater, and ii) comparative evaluation of polyethylene glycol (PEG), and ultrafiltration as virus concentration methods from wastewater for the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 genes.

In secondary analyses in which the suicide rates of 2020 were compared with the expected rates based on trends from 2011 to 2019, the increases in suicide rates were most pronounced among men aged younger than 30 years (eg, November: observed vs expected rate ratio [RR], 1.48 [95% CI, 1.26-1.71]) and women aged younger than 30 years (eg, October: observed vs expected RR, 2.14 [95% CI, 1.76 to 2.52]) and 30 to 49 years (eg, October: observed vs expected RR, 2.30 [95% CI, 2.01 to 2.58]).\n\nThese findings suggest that compared with previous years, suicide rates in Japan in 2020 increased in October and November for men and in July through November for women.", "doi": "10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.37378", "pmid": "33528554", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "2775740"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-02-04T18:23:24.857Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:45:47.814Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "ddbf17922ce142488599dc803aded789", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/ddbf17922ce142488599dc803aded789.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/ddbf17922ce142488599dc803aded789"}}, "title": "Risk of Severe Covid-19 in Patients with Celiac Disease: A Population-Based Cohort Study", "authors": [{"family": "Lebwohl", "given": "Benjamin", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Larsson", "given": "Emma", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "S\u00f6derling", "given": "Jonas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Roelstraete", "given": "Bjorn", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Murray", "given": "Joseph A", "initials": "JA"}, {"family": "Green", "given": "Peter HR", "initials": "PH"}, {"family": "Ludvigsson", "given": "Jonas F", "initials": "JF"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2021-02-00", "journal": {"title": "CLEP", "issn": "1179-1349", "volume": "Volume 13", "issue": null, "pages": "121-130", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.2147/clep.s294391", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Public Health": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-02-25T12:30:09.922Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:47:00.236Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "c5b8fd169aca45b880a478c279cf0888", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/c5b8fd169aca45b880a478c279cf0888.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/c5b8fd169aca45b880a478c279cf0888"}}, "title": "EHA/ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Malignant Lymphoma: Recommendations for the Second Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic.", "authors": [{"family": "Dreyling", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Aurer", "given": "Igor", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Federico", "given": "Massimo", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Jerkeman", "given": "Mats", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Kersten", "given": "Marie Jose", "initials": "MJ"}, {"family": "Linton", "given": "Kim", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Mey", "given": "Ulrich", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Tilly", "given": "Herve", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Buske", "given": "Christian", "initials": "C"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-02-00", "journal": {"title": "Hemasphere", "issn": "2572-9241", "volume": "5", "issue": "2", "pages": "e529", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1097/HS9.0000000000000529", "pmid": "33880434", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC8051991"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-04-23T04:38:11.381Z", "modified": "2021-04-23T04:38:11.403Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "b7f77ec5886a47618ad2a40f1ed9e96b", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/b7f77ec5886a47618ad2a40f1ed9e96b.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/b7f77ec5886a47618ad2a40f1ed9e96b"}}, "title": "A literature survey of the robotic technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic", "authors": [{"family": "Wang", "given": "Xi Vincent", "initials": "XV"}, {"family": "Wang", "given": "Lihui", "initials": "L"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2021-02-00", "journal": {"title": "Journal of Manufacturing Systems", "issn": "0278-6125", "issn-l": null, "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": null}, "abstract": "Since the late 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has been spread all around the world. The pandemic is a critical challenge to the health and safety of the general public, the medical staff and the medical systems worldwide. It has been globally proposed to utilise robots during the pandemic, to improve the treatment of patients and leverage the load of the medical system. However, there is still a lack of detailed and systematic review of the robotic research for the pandemic, from the technologies' perspective. Thus a thorough literature survey is conducted in this research and more than 280 publications have been reviewed, with the focus on robotics during the pandemic. The main contribution of this literature survey is to answer two research questions, i.e. 1) what the main research contributions are to combat the pandemic from the robotic technologies' perspective, and 2) what the promising supporting technologies are needed during and after the pandemic to help and guide future robotics research. The current achievements of robotic technologies are reviewed and discussed in different categories, followed by the identification of the representative work's technology readiness level. The future research trends and essential technologies are then highlighted, including artificial intelligence, 5 G, big data, wireless sensor network, and human-robot collaboration.", "doi":

Viral samples collected one and three days prior to symptoms exhibited infectivity on Vero E6 cells, confirmed by detection of double-stranded RNA by immunofluorescence, assessment of cytopathic effect (CPE) and rRT-PCR.

The aim of this study was to evaluate state resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic in psychiatric patients (PP), unaffected relatives (UR) and community controls (CC).\n\nThis study is part of the Barcelona ResIlience Survey for Mental Health COVID-19 (BRIS-MHC) project. Logistic regression models were performed to identify mental health outcomes associated with bad state resilience and predictors of good state resilience. The association between state resilience and specific affective temperaments as well as their influence on the association between depressive symptoms and state resilience were verified.\n\nThe study recruited 898 participants that took part in the survey. The presence of depressive symptoms was a predictor of bad state resilience in PP (\u03b2=0.110, OR=1.117, p=0.028). No specific mental health outcome was associated with bad state resilience in UR and CC. Predictors of good state resilience in PP were having pursued hobbies/conducted home tasks (\u03b2=1.261, OR=3.528, p=0.044) and level of organization in the family (\u03b2=0.986, OR=2.682, p=0.008).

M-MDSC frequencies were elevated in blood but not in nasopharyngeal or endotracheal aspirates of COVID-19 patients compared to controls. M-MDSCs isolated from COVID-19 patients suppressed T cell proliferation and IFN\u03b3 production partly via an arginase-1 (Arg-1) dependent mechanism. Furthermore, patients showed increased Arg-1 and IL-6 plasma levels. COVID-19 patients had fewer T cells, and displayed downregulated expression of the CD3\u03b6 chain.

While thousands of COVID-19 trials were rapidly started, many are unlikely to provide robust statistical evidence and meet regulatory standards, e.g. because of lack of randomisation or insufficient power. This has led to an inefficient use of time and resources. With more coordination, the sheer number of patients in these trials might have generated convincing data for several investigational treatments. Collaborative platform trials, comparing several drugs to a shared control arm, are an attractive solution. Those trials can utilise a variety of adaptive design features in order to accelerate the finding of life-saving treatments. In this manuscript we discuss several possible designs, illustrate them via simulations and also discuss challenges, such as the heterogeneity of the target population, time-varying standard of care, and the potentially high number of false hypothesis rejections in Phase 2 and Phase 3. We provide corresponding regulatory perspectives on approval and reimbursement, and note that the optimal design of a platform trial will differ with our societal objective and by stakeholder. Hasty approvals may delay the development of better alternatives, while searching relentlessly for the single most efficacious treatment may indirectly diminish the number of lives saved as time is lost.

This scoping review provides a summary of current evidence on the mental health consequences of COVID on HCWs. Methods: A scoping review was conducted searching PubMed and Embase for articles relevant to mental health conditions among HCWs during COVID-19. Relevant articles were screened and extracted to summarize key outcomes and findings. Results: A total of fifty-one studies were included in this review. Depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, psychological trauma, insomnia and sleep quality, workplace burnout and fatigue, and distress were the main outcomes reviewed. Most studies found a high number of symptoms endorsed for depression, anxiety, and other conditions. We found differences in symptoms by sex, age, and HCW role, with female, younger-aged, frontline workers, and non-physician workers being affected more than other subgroups. Conclusion: This review highlights the existing burden of mental health conditions reported by HCWs during COVID-19. It also demonstrates emerging disparities among affected HCW subgroups. This scoping review emphasizes the importance of generating high quality evidence and developing informed interventions for HCW mental health with a focus on LMICs.", "doi": "10.3389/fpsyt.2021.602614", "pmid": "33584383", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Public Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7873361"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-02-17T14:47:10.441Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:47:00.126Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "97ef8fbfc7b64b0b847e5d76a17538e1", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/97ef8fbfc7b64b0b847e5d76a17538e1.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/97ef8fbfc7b64b0b847e5d76a17538e1"}}, "title": "Factors associated with COVID-19-related death in people with rheumatic diseases: results from the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance physician-reported registry", "authors": [{"family": "Strangfeld", "given": "Anja", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Sch\u00e4fer", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Gianfrancesco", "given": "Milena A", "initials": "MA"}, {"family": "Lawson-Tovey", "given": "Saskia", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Liew", "given": "Jean W", "initials": "JW"}, {"family": "Ljung", "given": "Lotta", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Mateus", "given": "Elsa F", "initials": "EF"}, {"family": "Richez", "given": "Christophe", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Santos", "given": "Maria J", "initials": "MJ"}, {"family": "Schmajuk", "given": "Gabriela", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Scir\u00e8", "given": "Carlo A", "initials": "CA"}, {"family": "Sirotich", "given": "Emily", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Sparks", "given": "Jeffrey A", "initials": "JA"}, {"family": "Sufka", "given": "Paul", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Thomas", "given": "Thierry", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Trupin", "given": "Laura", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Wallace", "given": "Zachary S", "initials": "ZS"}, {"family": "Al-Adely", "given": "Sarah", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Bachiller-Corral", "given": "Javier", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Bhana", "given": "Suleman", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Cacoub", "given": "Patrice", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Carmona", "given": "Loreto", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Costello", "given": "Ruth", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Costello", "given": "Wendy", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Gossec", "given": "Laure", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Grainger", "given": "Rebecca", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Hachulla", "given": "Eric", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Hasseli", "given": "Rebecca", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Hausmann", "given": "Jonathan S", "initials": "JS"}, {"family": "Hyrich", "given": "Kimme L", "initials": "KL"}, {"family": "Izadi", "given": "Zara", "initials": "Z"}, {"family": "Jacobsohn", "given": "Lindsay", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Katz", "given": "Patricia", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Kearsley-Fleet", "given": "Lianne", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Robinson", "given": "Philip C", "initials": "PC"}, {"family": "Yazdany", "given": "Jinoos", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Machado", "given": "Pedro M", "initials": "PM"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2021-01-27", "journal": {"title": "Ann Rheum Dis", "issn": "1468-2060", "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": "annrheumdis-2020-219498", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "To determine factors associated with COVID-19-related death in people with rheumatic diseases.\n\nPhysician-reported registry of adults with rheumatic disease and confirmed or presumptive COVID-19 (from 24 March to 1 July 2020).

Here we address the question whether stress-associated neuroendocrine-immune mechanisms can possibly contribute to an increase in SARS-CoV-2 infections and influence the course of COVID-19 disease. Additionally, we discuss that not all forms of stress (e.g. acute versus chronic) are detrimental and that some types of stress could attenuate infection-risk and -progression. The overall aim of this review is to motivate future research efforts to clarify whether psychosocial interventions have the potential to optimize neuroendocrine-immune responses against respiratory viral infections during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. The current state of research on different types of stress is summarized in a comprehensive narrative review to promote a psychoneuroimmune understanding of how stress and its mediators cortisol, (nor)adrenaline, neuropeptides and neurotrophins can shape the immune defense against viral diseases. Based on this understanding, we describe how people with high psychosocial stress can be identified, which behaviors and psychosocial interventions may contribute to optimal stress management, and how psychoneuroimmune knowledge can be used to improve adequate care for COVID-19 and other patients with viral infections.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ynstr.2021.100296", "pmid": "33527083", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Public Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S2352-2895(21)00004-7"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7839386"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-02-04T18:18:58.208Z", "modified": "2021-03-04T14:58:22.507Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "a3ae0299260c4571aa064bee1cca91e8", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/a3ae0299260c4571aa064bee1cca91e8.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/a3ae0299260c4571aa064bee1cca91e8"}}, "title": "Anthropogenic Infection of Cats during the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic.", "authors": [{"family": "Hosie", "given": "Margaret J", "initials": "MJ"}, {"family": "Hofmann-Lehmann", "given": "Regina", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Hartmann", "given": "Katrin", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Egberink", "given": "Herman", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Truyen", "given": "Uwe", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Addie", "given": "Diane D", "initials": "DD"}, {"family": "Bel\u00e1k", "given": "S\u00e1ndor", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Boucraut-Baralon", "given": "Corine", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Frymus", "given": "Tadeusz", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Lloret", "given": "Albert", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Lutz", "given": "Hans", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Marsilio", "given": "Fulvio", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Pennisi", "given": "Maria Grazia", "initials": "MG"}, {"family": "Tasker", "given": "S\u00e9verine", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Thiry", "given": "Etienne", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "M\u00f6stl", "given": "Karin", "initials": "K"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-01-26", "journal": {"title": "Viruses", "issn": "1999-4915", "volume": "13", "issue": "2", "issn-l": "1999-4915"}, "abstract": "COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a new coronavirus (CoV), SARS-CoV-2, which is closely related to SARS-CoV that jumped the animal-human species barrier and caused a disease outbreak in 2003.

This paper is a descriptive study aims at describing the three community approaches that exist in Oman and reviewing their role in preparedness and response strategies to COVID-19 pandemic and discuss the lessons learned. Community participation approaches in Oman were translated into action during the pandemic through empowering community members, mobilizing resources, and strengthening the ownership among the local community to ensure effective advocacy, proper networking, and dissemination of information and, subsequently, actions at the level of the community. The first community participation approach is community organizations within the healthy cities and villages initiative, which facilitated networking and acted as a platform for community engagement, reviewing the health information and updating them accordingly to meet evloving demands. The second approach is Willayat (District) health committees, with their unique multi-sectoral structure, that enhanced collaboration at the state level with different community leaders and groups to develop pandemic action plans, which were implemented using available local resources. The third approach is community volunteers that remain the key information providers, particularly when physical access becomes limited due to physical distancing measures.

We developed a bispecific, IgG1-like molecule based on two antibodies derived from COVID-19 convalescent donors, C121 and C135 3 . CoV-X2 simultaneously binds two independent sites on the RBD and, unlike its parental antibodies, completely prevents S binding to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the virus cellular receptor. Furthermore, CoV-X2 recognizes a broad panel of RBD variants and neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and the escape mutants generated by the single monoclonals at sub-nanomolar concentrations. In a novel model of SARS-CoV-2 infection with lung inflammation, CoV-X2 protects mice from disease and suppresses viral escape.

Exploratory graph analysis and confirmatory factor analysis supported a two-factor model (cognitive and somatic fear), which were highly correlated (r = 0.84). The Norwegian version of the FCV-19S showed an underlying two-factor structure. However, the high correlation means the two latent factors (cognitive and somatic fear) act as indicators for a second-order general factor and support use of the FCV-19S sum score.

One of these concerns revolves around the pressing question: should providers continue to work in the absence of adequate PPE? Although the first peak of the COVID-19 crisis seems to have subsided and supply of PPE has increased, concerns about insufficient PPE availability remain. Inconsistent supply, limited efficacy, and continued high demand for PPE, combined with the continued threat of a second COVID-19 wave, mean that the issues surrounding PPE availability remain unresolved, including a duty to work. This paper offers an ethical investigation of whether neurosurgeons should perform their professional responsibilities with limited availability of PPE.

The efficacy of such vector-based vaccines depends on functional interactions with receptors on host cells. Adenoviruses of different species are assumed to enter host cells mainly by interactions between the knob domain of the protruding fiber capsid protein and cellular receptors. Using a cell-based receptor-screening assay, we identified CD46 as a receptor for HAdV-D56. The function of CD46 was validated in infection experiments using cells lacking and overexpressing CD46, and by competition infection experiments using soluble CD46. Remarkably, unlike HAdV-B types that engage CD46 through interactions with the knob domain of the fiber protein, HAdV-D types infect host cells through a direct interaction between CD46 and the hexon protein. Soluble hexon proteins (but not fiber knob) inhibited HAdV-D56 infection, and surface plasmon analyses demonstrated that CD46 binds to HAdV-D hexon (but not fiber knob) proteins. Cryoelectron microscopy analysis of the HAdV-D56 virion-CD46 complex confirmed the interaction and showed that CD46 binds to the central cavity of hexon trimers. Finally, soluble CD46 inhibited infection by 16 out of 17 investigated HAdV-D types, suggesting that CD46 is an important receptor for a large group of adenoviruses. In conclusion, this study identifies a noncanonical entry mechanism used by human adenoviruses, which adds to the knowledge of adenovirus biology and can also be useful for development of adenovirus-based vaccine vectors.", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2020732118", "pmid": "33384338", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Biochemistry": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "2020732118"}, {"db": "PDB", "key": "7AJP", "description": "Crystal Structure of Human Adenovirus 56 Fiber Knob"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-01-07T11:46:55.276Z", "modified": "2021-03-08T13:05:30.572Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "7e73071b4d804ba5bc0bf4d6733322a1", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7e73071b4d804ba5bc0bf4d6733322a1.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7e73071b4d804ba5bc0bf4d6733322a1"}}, "title": "Six-Month Survival After Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Severe COVID-19.", "authors": [{"family": "Biancari", "given": "Fausto", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Mariscalco", "given": "Giovanni", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Dal\u00e9n", "given": "Magnus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Settembre", "given": "Nicla", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Welp", "given": "Henryk", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Perrotti", "given": "Andrea", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Wiebe", "given": "Karsten", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Leo", "given": "Enrico", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Loforte", "given": "Antonio", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Chocron", "given": "Sidney", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Pacini", "given": "Davide", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Juvonen", "given": "Tatu", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Broman", "given": "L Mikael", "initials": "LM"}, {"family": "Perna", "given": "Dario Di", "initials": "DD"}, {"family": "Yusuff", "given": "Hakeem", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Harvey", "given": "Chris", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Mongardon", "given": "Nicolas", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Maureira", "given": "Juan P", "initials": "JP"}, {"family": "Levy", "given": "Bruno", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Falk", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Ruggieri", "given": "Vito G", "initials": "VG"}, {"family": "Zipfel", "given": "Svante", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Folliguet", "given": "Thierry", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Fiore", "given": "Antonio", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-01-19", "journal": {"title": "J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth", "issn": "1532-8422", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "The authors evaluated the outcome of adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).\n\nMulticenter retrospective, observational study.\n\nTen tertiary referral university and community hospitals.\n\nPatients with confirmed severe COVID-19-related ARDS.\n\nVenovenous or venoarterial ECMO.\n\nOne hundred thirty-two patients (mean age 51.1 \u00b1 9.7 years, female 17.4%) were treated with ECMO for confirmed severe COVID-19-related ARDS.

Therefore, the authors hypothesized that initiation of ECMO therapy before severe metabolic derangements subset may improve survival rates significantly in these patients. These results should be viewed in the light of a strict patient selection policy and may not be replicated in patients with advanced age or multiple comorbidities.\n\nidentifier, NCT04383678.", "doi": "10.1053/j.jvca.2021.01.027", "pmid": "33573928", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S1053-0770(21)00062-8"}, {"db": "ClinicalTrials.gov", "key": "NCT04383678", "description": null}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-02-15T17:22:42.437Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:45:48.401Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "5ade1e95279441e0bb8db1a9d3d813fa", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/5ade1e95279441e0bb8db1a9d3d813fa.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/5ade1e95279441e0bb8db1a9d3d813fa"}}, "title": "Nursing students' experiences of a pedagogical transition from campus learning to distance learning using digital tools.", "authors": [{"family": "Langeg\u00e5rd", "given": "Ulrica", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Kiani", "given": "Kiana", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Nielsen", "given": "Susanne J", "initials": "SJ"}, {"family": "Svensson", "given": "Per-Arne", "initials": "P"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-01-19", "journal": {"title": "BMC Nurs", "issn": "1472-6955", "issn-l": null, "volume": "20", "issue": "1", "pages": "23"}, "abstract": "The use of distance education using digital tools in higher education has increased over the last decade, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this study aimed to describe and evaluate nursing students' experiences of the pedagogical transition from traditional campus based learning to distance learning using digital tools.\r\n\r\nThe nursing course Symptom and signs of illness underwent a transition from campus based education to distance learning using digital tools because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This pedagogical transition in teaching was evaluated using both quantitative and qualitative data analysis. Focus group interviews (n = 9) were analysed using qualitative content analysis to explore students' experiences of the pedagogical transition and to construct a web-based questionnaire. The questionnaire comprised 14 items, including two open-ended questions. The questionnaire was delivered to all course participants and responses were obtained from 96 of 132 students (73%). Questionnaire data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and comments from the open-ended questions were used as quotes to highlight the quantitative data.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of the focus group interviews extracted three main dimensions: didactic aspects of digital teaching, study environment, and students' own resources. Social interaction was an overall theme included in all three dimensions. Data from the questionnaire showed that a majority of students preferred campus based education and experienced deterioration in all investigated dimensions after the pedagogical transition. However, approximately one-third of the students appeared to prefer distance learning using digital tools.\r\n\r\nThe main finding was that the pedagogical transition to distance education reduced the possibility for students' social interactions in their learning process. This negatively affected several aspects of their experience of distance learning using digital tools, such as reduced motivation. However, the heterogeneity in the responses suggested that a blended learning approach may offer pedagogical benefits while maintaining an advantageous level of social interaction.", "doi": "10.1186/s12912-021-00542-1", "pmid": "33468132", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Research Area: High-throughput and high-content serology": null, "Category: Public Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1186/s12912-021-00542-1"}, {"db": "NA", "key": "Available on request", "description": null}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-01-22T09:14:27.260Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:46:59.969Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "d302fafc56674dd383657bc91dd6780e", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/d302fafc56674dd383657bc91dd6780e.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/d302fafc56674dd383657bc91dd6780e"}}, "title": "Reporting suspicions of long COVID in children is justified during this global emergency.", "authors": [{"family": "Ludvigsson", "given": "Jonas F", "initials": "JF"}], "type": "letter", "published": "2021-01-18", "journal": {"title": "Acta Paediatr", "issn": "1651-2227", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": "0803-5253"}, "abstract": "I would like to thank Peny and Valind (1) for raising a number of issues with regard to my recent paper in Acta Paediatrica, which was based on parental reports of what appeared to be long COVID in Sweden (2).

However, it is unclear if differences, reflected by serum renin levels, exist in the basal renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) between children and adults, boys, and girls as well as young women and young men. Furthermore, it remains to be investigated if renin and soluble ACE2 (sACE2) levels are correlated with body mass index (BMI) in children and young adults. The aim of this observational study was to assess age-and sex differences in serum renin, and the relationship between renin, soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and body mass index in a prospectively followed population-based cohort of children which were followed into young adulthood. Study Design: We analyzed renin and sACE2 in serum in a prospectively followed population-based cohort at 9.9 (0.6) [mean (SD)] (n = 173), 11.7 (0.6) (n = 156), 14.8 (0.8) (n = 149), 18.8 (0.3) (n = 93), and 23.5 (0.7) (n = 152) years of age. Height (cm) and weight (kg) was measured and body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m)2. Sex-related differences in renin levels were calculated using analysis of covariance, adjusted for age. Correlations were assessed by calculating the correlation coefficient (R2) using a multivariable linear mixed model. Results: Both sexes had low renin levels up to 12 years of age. Thereafter renin levels increased more in boys than in girls. Males from the age of 15 had significantly higher levels than females (p < 0.001). There was a positive linear relationship between renin and sACE2 levels in male and female subjects (p < 0.001), and between sACE2 levels and BMI in males (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Renin levels increase with age, are higher in men than in women since around puberty, and are correlated with sACE2 levels. Furthermore, sACE2 levels are correlated with body mass index in males. These findings indicate that high renin levels in males and females and a high BMI in males may activate pathways which increase the shedding of mACE2, with possible implications for the risk of

The incidence of heart failure, stroke, and bleeding was not different between groups, but hospital stay was longer during COVID-19 (6.85 \u00b1 4.22 vs. 3.5 \u00b1 2.3 day, p = 0.0025). Conclusion: At the ICC, COVID-19 pandemic contributed significantly to the PPCI management of STEMI patients with decreased number and delayed procedures. COVID-19 was also associated with higher in-hospital mortality, rate of re-infarction, need for revascularization, and longer hospital stay.", "doi": "10.3390/jcm10020278", "pmid": "33466588",

NVX-CoV2373 S form 27.2-nm nanoparticles that are thermostable and bind with high affinity to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. In mice, low-dose NVX-CoV2373 with saponin-based Matrix-M adjuvant elicit high titer anti-S IgG that blocks hACE2 receptor binding, neutralize virus, and protects against SARS-CoV-2 challenge with no evidence of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease. NVX-CoV2373 also elicits multifunctional CD4 + and CD8+ T cells, CD4+ follicular helper T cells (Tfh), and antigen-specific germinal center (GC) B cells in the spleen. In baboons, low-dose levels of NVX-CoV2373 with Matrix-M was also highly immunogenic and elicited high titer anti-S antibodies and functional antibodies that block S-protein binding to hACE2 and neutralize virus infection and antigen-specific T cells. These results support the ongoing phase 1/2 clinical evaluation of the safety and immunogenicity of NVX-CoV2373 with Matrix-M (NCT04368988).", "doi": "10.1038/s41467-020-20653-8", "pmid": "33446655", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Biochemistry": null, "Category: Drug Discovery": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-01-15T13:07:39.769Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:45:25.904Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "9ffbffb4b03446888ea96e3df6f24fa8", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/9ffbffb4b03446888ea96e3df6f24fa8.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/9ffbffb4b03446888ea96e3df6f24fa8"}}, "title": "Self-Perceived Changes in Physical Activity and the Relation to Life Satisfaction and Rated Physical Capacity in Swedish Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic-A Cross Sectional Study.", "authors": [{"family": "Eek", "given": "Frida", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Larsson", "given": "Caroline", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Wis\u00e9n", "given": "Anita", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Ekvall Hansson", "given": "Eva", "initials": "E"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-01-14", "journal": {"title": "Int J Environ Res Public Health", "issn": "1660-4601", "volume": "18", "issue": "2", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "COVID-19 restrictions may prevent people from reaching recommended levels of physical activity (PA).

The survey included questions regarding perceived changes in PA compared to the previous year, the \"Rating of Perceived Capacity\" scale and \"Life Satisfaction Questionnaire-11\". A change in PA was reported by 65% of participants. More participants reported an increase (36%) than a decrease (29%), however a decrease in PA was significantly more often considered to be due to the pandemic. The highest odds of decreased PA was found in the oldest age group (70+ years) (OR 2.8; 95% CI 1.4-5.7). Those who reported decreased levels of PA reported lower life satisfaction and aerobic capacity than the other groups ( p > 0.001). Decreased physical activity was reported by many, but an equal share reported increased activity during the pandemic.

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in December 2019, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). No qualitative assessment has yet described the physical and mental health conditions of frontline medical personnel in the COVID-19 outbreaks. Methods: Here, 251 frontline medical personnel involved in COVID-19 missions completed electronic questionnaires, consisting of 31 categorical variables related to their physical and mental health status, medical history and environmental conditions. We constructed a correlation amongst these variables through pairwise Kendall rank correlation coefficient test. Then, clusters of highly correlated variables were identified using the leading eigenvector. Finally, we used the network and clusters to clarify the correlations amongst variables. Results: This qualitative study identified the six clusters. Cluster 1 was characterized by skin allergy. Cluster 2 was predominantly associated with anxiety. Cluster 3 consisted mostly of respiratory symptoms. The participants in cluster 4 had medical history. Cluster 5 and cluster 6 were characterized by disinfection and demography, respectively. Finally, we revealed three major findings. First, more than 80% of medical personnel worry about COVID-19-related infection and experience newly appearing anxiety (56.2%), airway or heart symptoms (34.3%) and skin allergies (20.3%). Second, COVID-19-related worry significantly associates with all variables in the anxiety and respiratory symptom clusters.

The increased amount of data on the efficacy and safety of B-cell-depleting therapies from several studies has suggested the addition of these drugs as treatment options to the current armamentarium of disease modifying therapies (DMTs) for MS. Particularly, rituximab (RTX), a chimeric monoclonal antibody directed at CD20 positive B lymphocytes resulting in cell-mediated apoptosis, has been demonstrated to reduce inflammatory activity, incidence of relapses and new brain lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Additional evidence also demonstrated that patients with progressive MS (PMS) may benefit from RTX, which also showed to be well tolerated, with acceptable safety risks and favorable cost-effectiveness profile.Despite these encouraging results, RTX is currently approved for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, several forms of vasculitis and rheumatoid arthritis, while it can only be administered off-label for MS treatment. Between Northern European countries exist different rules for using not licensed drug for treating MS. The Sweden MS register reports a high rate (53.5%) of off-label RTX prescriptions in relation to other annually started DMTs to treat MS patients, while Danish and Norwegian neurologists have to use other anti-CD20 drugs, as ocrelizumab, in most of the cases.In this paper, we review the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy, safety profile and cost effectiveness aspects of RTX for the treatment of MS.

Marginalized groups and individuals are particularly vulnerable to adverse effects of the pandemic such as human rights abuses and violations which can lead to psychological distress. In this review, we focus on mental distress and disturbances that have emanated due to human rights restrictions and violations amidst the pandemic. We underscore how mental health is both directly impacted by the force of pandemic and by prevention and mitigation structures put in place to combat the disease. Methods: We conducted a review of relevant studies examining human rights violations in COVID-19 response, with a focus on vulnerable populations, and its association with mental health and psychological well-being. We searched PubMed and Embase databases for studies between December 2019 to July 2020. Three reviewers evaluated the eligibility criteria and extracted data. Results: Twenty-four studies were included in the systematic inquiry reporting on distress due to human rights violations. Unanimously, the studies found vulnerable populations to be at a high risk for mental distress. Limited mobility rights disproportionately harmed psychiatric patients, low-income individuals, and minorities who were at higher risk for self-harm and worsening mental health. Healthcare workers suffered negative mental health consequences due to stigma and lack of personal protective equipment and stigma. Other vulnerable groups such as the elderly, children, and refugees also experienced negative consequences. Conclusions: This review emphasizes the need to uphold human rights and address long term mental health needs of populations that have suffered disproportionately during the pandemic. Countries can embed a proactive psychosocial response to medical management as well as in existing prevention strategies. International human rights guidelines are useful in this direction but an emphasis should be placed on strengthening rights informed psychosocial response with specific strategies to enhance mental health in the long-term. We underscore that various fundamental human rights are interdependent and therefore undermining one leads to a poor impact on the others. We strongly recommend global efforts toward focusing both on minimizing fatalities, protecting human rights, and promoting long term mental well-being.", "doi": "10.3389/fpsyt.2020.603875", "pmid": "33488426", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7820171"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-02-04T18:39:24.005Z", "modified": "2021-02-04T18:39:33.273Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "02eaf5bdae9e4092b8b24cd7533ece27", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/02eaf5bdae9e4092b8b24cd7533ece27.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/02eaf5bdae9e4092b8b24cd7533ece27"}}, "title": "COVID-19 epidemic in Libya.", "authors": [{"family": "Bredan", "given": "Amin", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Bakoush", "given": "Omran", "initials": "O"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-01-08", "journal": {"title": "Libyan J Med", "issn": "1819-6357", "issn-l": null, "volume": "16", "issue": "1", "pages": "1871798"}, "abstract": "The first case of COVID-19 was identified in Libya on 24/3/2020, and about 2 months later, the number of reported COVID-19 cases started to increase notably.

Covid-19-positive patients had considerably worse outcomes than patients with negative test results, with 30-day mortality rates of 24% vs 11%, but lower levels of prehospital acuity (e.g. emergent transport rates of 14% vs 22%). About half (46%) of Covid-19-positive patients presented to dispatchers with primary complaints typically associated with Covid-19.

Although acquired and resistance immunity is one of the most important aspects of alleviating the trend of the current pandemic; however, there is still a big gap of knowledge regarding the infection process, immunopathogenesis, recovery, and reinfection.\n\nTo answer the questions regarding \"the potential and probability of reinfection in COVID-19 infected cases\" or \"the efficiency and duration of SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced immunity against reinfection\" we critically evaluated the current reports on SARS-CoV-2 immunity and reinfection with special emphasis on comparative studies using animal models that generalize their finding about protection and reinfection. Also, the contribution of humoral immunity in the process of COVID-19 recovery and the role of ACE2 in virus infectivity and pathogenesis has been discussed. Furthermore, innate and cellular immunity and inflammatory responses in the disease and recovery conditions are reviewed and an overall outline of immunologic aspects of COVID-19 progression and recovery in three different stages are presented. Finally, we categorized the infected cases into four different groups based on the acquired immunity and the potential for reinfection.\n\nIn this review paper, we proposed a new strategy to predict the potential of reinfection in each identified category.

However, the substantial gains achieved since entry into force of MLC in August 2013 appear to have been severely dented by the COVID-19 global pandemic. The aim of the study was to examine, on a pilot basis, the disruptions and challenges to the observance of seafarers' rights to shore leave, repatriation and medical assistance as an immediate consequence of COVID-19.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 on seafarers' rights was examined in three dimensions - shore leave, repatriation and medical assistance.

The paper discusses the results of the survey.\n\nThe research revealed a previously unknown majority preference for shore leave, that diminished sharply during COVID-19. Impact on work-performance and well-being of seafarers was revealed with only a fifth of the seafarers having willingly agreed to an extension of contract. This study revealed incidence rates at 6 months into the pandemic of several parameters - delayed repatriations (21.44%) that includes crew with contract extensions (12.48%), crew with completed contract awaiting repatriation (8.96%) and crew that had exceeded 12-month continuous service (0.82%).

Deprivation of medical assistance was also revealed.\n\nThe well being of seafarers would likely remain vulnerable to breaches, unless measures are put in place to safeguard the rights assured under

recently addressed factors associated with severe Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, some medications and comorbidities have yet to be evaluated in a large matched cohort. We therefore explored the role of relevant comorbidities and medications in relation to the risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality.\r\n\r\nMethods: All ICU COVID-19 patients in Sweden until 27 May 2020 were matched to population controls on age and sex to assess the risk of ICU admission. Cases were identified, comorbidities and medications were retrieved from high-quality registries. Three conditional logistic regression models were used for risk of ICU admission and three Cox proportional hazards models for risk of ICU mortality, one with comorbidities, one with medications and finally with both models combined, respectively.\r\n\r\nResults: We included 1981 patients and 7924 controls. Hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, asthma, obesity, being a solid organ transplant recipient and immunosuppressant medications were independent risk factors of ICU admission and oral anticoagulants were protective. Stroke, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and treatment with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors (RAASi) were independent risk factors of ICU mortality in the pre-specified primary analyses; treatment with statins was protective. However, after adjusting for the use of continuous renal replacement therapy, RAASi were no longer an independent risk factor.\r\n\r\nConclusion: In our cohort oral anticoagulants were protective of ICU admission and statins was protective of ICU death. Several comorbidities and ongoing RAASi treatment were independent risk factors of ICU admission and ICU mortality.\r\n\r\nThis article is protected by", "doi": "10.1111/aas.13781", "pmid": "33438198", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "NA", "key": "Available on request", "description": null}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-01-04T09:13:48.635Z", "modified": "2021-03-25T14:21:42.387Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "52f8c81d169e44dfa9c5a9e9ee5622a8", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/52f8c81d169e44dfa9c5a9e9ee5622a8.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/52f8c81d169e44dfa9c5a9e9ee5622a8"}}, "title": "Little evidence for facemask use in children against COVID-19.", "authors": [{"family": "Ludvigsson", "given": "Jonas F", "initials": "JF"}], "type": "editorial", "published": "2021-01-03", "journal": {"title": "Acta Paediatr", "issn": "1651-2227", "issn-l": "0803-5253", "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": null}, "abstract": "Editorial", "doi": "10.1111/apa.15729", "pmid": "33393117", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-01-07T09:56:13.495Z", "modified": "2021-01-07T09:56:56.673Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "6d40a9ed6d164a33a7968a3d377566db", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/6d40a9ed6d164a33a7968a3d377566db.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/6d40a9ed6d164a33a7968a3d377566db"}}, "title": "Treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a systematic review of in vitro, in vivo, and clinical trials.", "authors": [{"family": "Han", "given": "Young Joo", "initials": "YJ"}, {"family": "Lee", "given": "Keum Hwa", "initials": "KH"}, {"family": "Yoon", "given": "Sojung", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Nam", "given": "Seoung Wan", "initials": "SW"}, {"family": "Ryu", "given": "Seohyun", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Seong", "given": "Dawon", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Kim", "given": "Jae Seok", "initials": "JS"}, {"family": "Lee", "given": "Jun Young", "initials": "JY"}, {"family": "Yang", "given": "Jae Won", "initials": "JW"}, {"family": "Lee", "given": "Jinhee", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Koyanagi", "given": "Ai", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Hong", "given": "Sung Hwi", "initials": "SH"}, {"family": "Dragioti", "given": "Elena", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Radua", "given": "Joaquim", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Smith", "given": "Lee", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Oh", "given": "Hans", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Ghayda", "given": "Ramy Abou", "initials": "RA"}, {"family": "Kronbichler", "given": "Andreas", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Effenberger", "given": "Maria", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Kresse", "given": "Daniela", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Denicol\u00f2", "given": "Sara", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Kang", "given": "Woosun", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Jacob", "given": "Louis", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Shin", "given": "Hanwul", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Shin", "given": "Jae Il", "initials": "JI"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-01-01", "journal": {"title": "Theranostics", "issn": "1838-7640", "volume": "11", "issue": "3", "pages": "1207-1231", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Rationale: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide and poses a threat to humanity. However, no specific therapy has been established for this disease yet. We conducted a systematic review to highlight therapeutic agents that might be effective in treating COVID-19. Methods: We searched Medline, Medrxiv.org, and reference lists of relevant publications to identify articles of in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies on treatments for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19 published in English until the last update on October 11, 2020. Results: We included 36 studies on SARS, 30 studies on MERS, and 10 meta-analyses on SARS and MERS in this study. Through 12,200 title and 830 full-text screenings for COVID-19, eight in vitro studies, 46 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on 6,886 patients, and 29 meta-analyses were obtained and investigated. There was no therapeutic agent that consistently resulted in positive outcomes across SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Remdesivir showed a therapeutic effect for COVID-19 in two RCTs involving the largest number of total participants (n = 1,461).

In this paper, we draw from the emerging evidence on behaviour adoption during diverse public health emergencies to develop a framework that contextualises behaviour adoption vis-\u00e0-vis a combination of top-down, intermediary and bottom-up approaches. Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a case study, we operationalise the contextual framework to demonstrate how these three approaches differ in terms of their implementation, underlying drivers of action, enforcement, reach and uptake. We illustrate how blended strategies that include all three approaches can help accelerate and sustain protective behaviours that will remain important even when safe and effective vaccines become more widely available. As the world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic and prepares to respond to (re)emerging public health threats, our contextual framework can inform the design, implementation, tracking and evaluation of comprehensive public health and social measures during health emergencies.", "doi": "10.1136/bmjgh-2020-004450", "pmid": "33514594", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Public Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "bmjgh-2020-004450"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7849902"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-02-04T18:43:49.858Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:47:00.252Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "d12ec989605142b5bc38043f089487db", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/d12ec989605142b5bc38043f089487db.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/d12ec989605142b5bc38043f089487db"}}, "title": "Temporal increase in D614G mutation of SARS-CoV-2 in the Middle East and North Africa.", "authors": [{"family": "Sallam", "given": "Malik", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Ababneh", "given": "Nidaa A", "initials": "NA"}, {"family": "Dababseh", "given": "Deema", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Bakri", "given": "Faris G", "initials": "FG"}, {"family": "Mahafzah", "given": "Azmi", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-01-00", "journal": {"title": "Heliyon", "issn": "2405-8440", "volume": "7", "issue": "1", "pages": "e06035", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Phylogeny construction can help to reveal evolutionary relatedness among molecular sequences.

Here, the aim is to present simple metrics of such precision shielding of people at high risk of death after infection by SARS-CoV-2; demonstrate how they can estimated; and examine whether precision shielding was successfully achieved in the first COVID-19 wave. The shielding ratio, S, is defined as the ratio of prevalence of infection among people in a high-risk group versus among people in a low-risk group. The contrasted risk groups examined here are according to age (\u226570 vs <70 years), and institutionalised (nursing home) setting. For age-related precision shielding, data were used from large seroprevalence studies with separate prevalence data for elderly versus non-elderly and with at least 1000 assessed people\u226570 years old. For setting-related precision shielding, data were analysed from 10 countries where information was available on numbers of nursing home residents, proportion of nursing home residents among COVID-19 deaths and overall population infection fatality rate (IFR). Across 17 seroprevalence studies, the shielding ratio S for elderly versus non-elderly varied between 0.4 (substantial shielding) and 1.6 (substantial inverse protection, that is, low-risk people being protected more than high-risk people). Five studies in the USA all yielded S=0.4-0.8, consistent with some shielding being achieved, while two studies in China yielded S=1.5-1.6, consistent with inverse protection. Assuming 25% IFR among nursing home residents, S values for nursing home residents ranged from 0.07 to 3.1. The best shielding was seen in South Korea (S=0.07) and modest shielding was achieved in Israel, Slovenia, Germany and Denmark. No shielding was achieved in Hungary and Sweden. In Belgium (S=1.9), the UK (S=2.2) and Spain (S=3.1), nursing home residents were far more frequently infected than the rest of the population. In conclusion, the experience from the first wave of COVID-19 suggests that different locations and settings varied markedly in the extent to which they protected high-risk groups. Both effective precision shielding and detrimental inverse protection can happen in real-life circumstances. COVID-19 interventions should seek to achieve maximal precision shielding.", "doi": "10.1136/bmjgh-2020-004614", "pmid": "33514595", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key":

Answers to these questions are important for development practitioners, who need to understand how different partnerships might affect health behavior, and for scholars interested in understanding authority, legitimacy, and compliance. We explore these questions using a conjoint experiment embedded in a telephone survey of 641 Malawians. Individuals in our sample are more likely to say that they will comply with precautionary measures when the costs are low and expected benefits are high. Respondents view both traditional authorities and hospital heads as legitimately issuing directives and having the ability to monitor and sanction non-compliance, but appear to comply more with hospital heads and to do so out of respect for their expertise. These results emphasize how who issues directives affects whether individuals comply and provides insights as to why they do so. The findings also reflect individuals' cost-benefit calculations when considering precautionary measures, highlighting the importance of steps that can reduce costs (e.g., food security or income measures) or accurately reflect risks (e.g., information signaling the prevalence of Covid-19).

COVID-19 often affects patients with pre-existing cardiac disease, and may trigger acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), venous thromboembolism (VTE), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and acute heart failure (AHF). However, as COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory infectious disease, there remain substantial uncertainty and controversy whether and how cardiovascular biomarkers should be used in patients with suspected COVID-19. To help clinicians understand the possible value as well as the most appropriate interpretation of cardiovascular biomarkers in COVID-19, it is important to highlight that recent findings regarding the prognostic role of cardiovascular biomarkers in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are similar to those obtained in studies for pneumonia and ARDS in general. Cardiovascular biomarkers reflecting pathophysiological processes involved in COVID-19/pneumonia and its complications have a role evaluating disease severity, cardiac involvement, and risk of death in COVID-19 as well as in pneumonias caused by other pathogens. First, cardiomyocyte injury, as quantified by cardiac troponin concentrations, and haemodynamic cardiac stress, as quantified by natriuretic peptide concentrations, may occur in COVID-19 as in other pneumonias. The level of those biomarkers correlates with disease severity and mortality. Interpretation of cardiac troponin and natriuretic peptide concentrations as quantitative variables may aid in risk stratification in COVID-19/pneumonia and also will ensure that these biomarkers maintain high diagnostic accuracy for AMI and AHF. Second, activated coagulation as quantified by D-dimers seems more prominent in COVID-19 as in other pneumonias. Due to the central role of endothelitis and VTE in COVID-19, serial measurements of D-dimers may help physicians in the selection of patients for VTE imaging and the intensification of the level of anticoagulation from prophylactic to slightly higher or even therapeutic doses.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjacc/zuab009", "pmid": "33655301", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null,

Of 15,539 grid cells, 559 (3.6%) contained at least one case, and these were used to construct a Poisson regression model of cell-weeks. Weather parameters were taken for the preceding week given the established 5-7 day incubation period for COVID-19. The dependent variable in the Poisson model was incident cases per cell-week and exposure was cell population, allowing for clustering of cells over weeks, to give incidence rate ratios.Results: The overall COVID-19 incidence rate in cells with confirmed cases was 0.12 per 1,000. There was a single confirmed case in 113/559 (20.2%) of cells, while two grid cells recorded over 1,000 confirmed cases. Weekly means of maximum daily temperature varied from -28.0\u00b0C to 30.1\u00b0C, minimum daily temperature from -42.4\u00b0C to 23.0\u00b0C, maximum solar radiation from 0.04 to 2.74 MJm-2 and total precipitation from 0 to 72.6 mm. Adjusted incidence rate ratios suggested brighter, warmer and drier conditions were associated with lower incidence.Conclusion: Though not demonstrating cause and effect, there were appreciable associations between weather and COVID-19 incidence during the epidemic in China. This does not mean the pandemic will go away with summer weather but demonstrates the importance of using weather conditions in understanding and forecasting the spread of COVID-19.", "doi": "10.1080/16549716.2020.1760490", "pmid": "32404043", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Public Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7269037"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-10T08:44:08.879Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:46:59.993Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "f15874bd4c424661b8db73c43a1afd31", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/f15874bd4c424661b8db73c43a1afd31.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/f15874bd4c424661b8db73c43a1afd31"}}, "title": "Time Trends of the Public\u2019s Attention Toward Suicide During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Retrospective, Longitudinal Time-Series Study", "authors": [{"family": "Burnett", "given": "Dayle", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Eapen", "given": "Valsamma", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Lin", "given": "Ping I", "initials": "PI"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2020-12-30", "journal": {"title": "JMIR Public Health Surveill", "issn": "2369-2960", "volume": "6", "issue": "4", "pages": "e24694", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.2196/24694", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Public Health": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-01-10T18:13:57.524Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:47:00.305Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "b1cc2da76ba543f9849597117e7652f0", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/b1cc2da76ba543f9849597117e7652f0.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/b1cc2da76ba543f9849597117e7652f0"}}, "title": "Longitudinal variability in mortality predicts Covid-19 deaths", "authors": [{"family": "Lundberg", "given": "Jon O", "initials": "JO"}, {"family": "Zeberg", "given": "Hugo", "initials": "H"}], "type": "posted-content", "published": "2020-12-30", "journal": {"title": "medRxiv", "issn": null, "issn-l": null, "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1101/2020.12.25.20248853", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Type: Preprint": null, "Funder: VR": null, "Category: Health": null, "Category: Other": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-01-08T07:12:04.340Z", "modified": "2021-03-25T14:08:59.456Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "af36f6a1c29d4c64bd3c8e3c58546657", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/af36f6a1c29d4c64bd3c8e3c58546657.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/af36f6a1c29d4c64bd3c8e3c58546657"}}, "title": "COVID-19 spatiotemporal research with workflow-based data analysis.", "authors": [{"family": "Chintala", "given": "Srikar", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Dutta", "given": "Ritvik", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Tadmor", "given": "Doron", "initials": "D"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-12-30", "journal": {"title": "Infect Genet Evol", "issn": "1567-7257", "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": "104701", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Given the pertinence and acceleration of the spread of COVID-19, there is an increased need for the replicability of data models to verify the veracity of models and visualize important data. Most of these visualizations lack reproducibility, credibility, or accuracy, and are static, which makes it difficult to analyze the spread over time. Furthermore, most current visualizations depicting the spread of COVID-19 are at a global or country level, meaning there is a dearth of regional analysis within a country. Keeping these issues in mind, a replicable, efficient, and simple method to generate regional COVID-19 visualizations mapped with time was created by using the KNIME software, an open-source data analytics platform that can create user-friendly applications or workflows. For this analysis, Albania, Sweden, Ukraine, Denmark, Russia, India, and Australia were closely observed. Among the maps generated for the aforementioned countries, it was noticed that regions with a high population or high population density were often the epicenters within their respective country. The regions caused the virus to spread to their neighboring regions: kickstarting the \"domino effect\", leading to the infection of another region until the country is overwhelmed with cases-what we call a proximity trend. These dynamic maps are crucial to fighting the pandemic because they can provide insight as to how COVID-19 spreads by providing researchers or officials with an accurate and insightful tool to aid their analysis. By being able to visualize the spread, health and government officials can dive deeper to identify the sources of transmission and attempt to stop or reverse them accordingly.", "doi": "10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104701", "pmid": "33387692", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S1567-1348(20)30532-3"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7773529"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-01-07T11:21:45.756Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:46:13.433Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "95a37cbd41734367bc2b23e615569b9f", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/95a37cbd41734367bc2b23e615569b9f.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/95a37cbd41734367bc2b23e615569b9f"}}, "title": "Integrating the social sciences in epidemic preparedness and response: A strategic framework to strengthen capacities and improve Global Health security.", "authors": [{"family": "Bardosh", "given": "Kevin Louis", "initials": "KL"}, {"family": "de Vries", "given": "Daniel H", "initials": "DH"}, {"family": "Abramowitz", "given": "Sharon", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Thorlie", "given": "Adama", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Cremers", "given": "Lianne", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Kinsman", "given": "John", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Stellmach", "given": "Darryl", "initials": "D"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-12-30", "journal": {"title": "Global Health", "issn": "1744-8603", "volume": "16", "issue": "1", "pages": "120", "issn-l": "1744-8603"}, "abstract": "The importance of integrating the social sciences in epidemic preparedness and response has become a common feature of infectious disease policy and practice debates. However to date, this integration remains inadequate, fragmented and under-funded, with limited reach and small initial investments. Based on data collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, in this paper we analysed the variety of knowledge, infrastructure and funding gaps that hinder the full integration of the social sciences in epidemics and present a strategic framework for addressing them.\n\nSenior social scientists with expertise in public health emergencies facilitated expert deliberations, and conducted 75 key informant interviews, a consultation with 20 expert social scientists from Africa, Asia and Europe, 2 focus groups and a literature review of 128 identified high-priority peer reviewed articles. We also analysed 56 interviews from the Ebola 100 project, collected just after the West African Ebola epidemic. Analysis was conducted on gaps and recommendations. These were inductively classified according to various themes during two group prioritization exercises. The project was conducted between February and May 2019. Findings from the report were used to inform strategic prioritization of global investments in social science capacities for health emergencies.\n\nOur analysis consolidated 12 knowledge and infrastructure gaps and 38 recommendations from an initial list of 600 gaps and 220 recommendations. In developing our framework, we clustered these into three areas: 1) Recommendations to improve core social science response capacities, including investments in: human resources within response agencies; the creation of social science data analysis capacities at field and global level; mechanisms for operationalizing knowledge; and a set of rapid deployment infrastructures; 2) Recommendations to strengthen applied and basic social sciences, including the need to: better define the social science agenda and core competencies; support innovative interdisciplinary science; make concerted investments in developing field ready tools and building the evidence-base; and develop codes of conduct; and 3) Recommendations for a supportive social science ecosystem, including: the essential foundational investments in institutional development; training and capacity building; awareness-raising activities with allied disciplines; and lastly, support for a community of practice.\n\nComprehensively integrating social science into the epidemic preparedness and response architecture demands multifaceted investments on par with allied disciplines, such as epidemiology and virology. Building core capacities and competencies should occur at multiple levels, grounded in country-led capacity building. Social science should not be a parallel system, nor should it be \"siloed\" into risk communication and community engagement. Rather, it should be integrated across existing systems and networks, and deploy interdisciplinary knowledge \"transversally\" across all preparedness and response sectors and pillars. Future work should update this framework to account for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the institutional landscape.", "doi": "10.1186/s12992-020-00652-6", "pmid": "33380341", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Public Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1186/s12992-020-00652-6"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7772799"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-01-07T12:10:19.942Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:47:00.083Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "2b3f61fe73ac49f0b91cc6fc002bcc7c", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/2b3f61fe73ac49f0b91cc6fc002bcc7c.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/2b3f61fe73ac49f0b91cc6fc002bcc7c"}}, "title": "ACE2: the molecular doorway to SARS-CoV-2.", "authors": [{"family": "Medina-Enr\u00edquez", "given": "Miriam Marlene", "initials": "MM"}, {"family": "Lopez-Le\u00f3n", "given": "Sandra", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Carlos-Escalante", "given": "Jos\u00e9 Alberto", "initials": "JA"}, {"family": "Aponte-Torres", "given": "Zuleika", "initials": "Z"}, {"family": "Cuapio", "given": "Angelica", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Wegman-Ostrosky", "given": "Talia", "initials": "T"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-12-30", "journal": {"title": "Cell Biosci", "issn": "2045-3701", "volume": "10", "issue": "1", "pages": "148", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the host functional receptor for the new virus SARS-CoV-2 causing Coronavirus Disease 2019.

ZIKV is a vector borne Flavivirus that is spread by mosquitoes and it mainly infects neuronal progenitor cells. One hallmark of congenital ZIKV disease is a reduced brain size in fetuses, leading to severe neurological defects. The World Health Organization (WHO) is urging the development of new antiviral treatments against ZIKV, as there are no efficient countermeasures against ZIKV disease. Previously, we presented a new class of host-targeting antivirals active against a number of pathogenic RNA viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show the transfer of the image-based phenotypic antiviral assay to ZIKV-infected brain cells, followed by mechanism-of-action studies and a proof-of-concept study in a three-dimensional (3D) organoid model. The novel antiviral compounds showed a therapeutic window against ZIKV in several cell models and rescued ZIKV-induced neurotoxicity in brain organoids. The compound's mechanism-of-action was pinpointed to late steps in the virus life cycle, impairing the formation of new virus particles.

global pandemic as declared by World Health Organization (WHO). In the absence of an effective treatment in early 2020, different drugs with unknown effectiveness, including antimalarial hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), with or without concurrent administration with azithromycin (AZM), have been tested for treating COVID-19 patients with developed pneumonia. However, the efficacy and safety of HCQ and/or AZM have been questioned by recent clinical reports. Direct effects of these drugs on the human heart remain very poorly defined. To better understand the mechanisms of action of HCQ +/- AZM, we employed bioengineered human ventricular cardiac tissue strip (hvCTS) and anisotropic sheet (hvCAS) assays, made with human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes (hvCMs), which have been designed for measuring cardiac contractility and electrophysiology, respectively. Our hvCTS experiments showed that AZM induced a dose-dependent negative inotropic effect which could be aggravated by HCQ; electrophysiologically, as revealed by the hvCAS platform, AZM prolonged action potentials and induced spiral wave formations. Collectively, our data were consistent with reported clinical risks of HCQ and AZM on QTc prolongation/ventricular arrhythmias and development of heart failure. In conclusion, our study exposed the risks of HCQ/AZM administration while providing mechanistic insights for their toxicity. Our bioengineered human cardiac tissue constructs therefore provide a useful platform for screening cardiac safety and efficacy when developing therapeutics against COVID-19.", "doi":

We aimed to study whether there is risk of incident depression, suicidal ideation or psychosis associated with HCQ as used for RA.\n\nWe performed a new-user cohort study using claims and electronic medical records from 10 sources and 3 countries (Germany, UK and USA). RA patients \u226518 years of age and initiating HCQ were compared with those initiating SSZ (active comparator) and followed up in the short (30 days) and long term (on treatment). Study outcomes included depression, suicide/suicidal ideation and hospitalization for psychosis. Propensity score stratification and calibration using negative control outcomes were used to address confounding. Cox models were fitted to estimate database-specific calibrated hazard ratios (HRs), with estimates pooled where I2 <40%.\n\nA total of 918 144 and 290 383 users of HCQ and SSZ, respectively, were included. No consistent risk of psychiatric events was observed with short-term HCQ (compared with SSZ) use, with meta-analytic HRs of 0.96 (95% CI 0.79, 1.16) for depression, 0.94 (95% CI 0.49, 1.77) for suicide/suicidal ideation and 1.03 (95% CI 0.66, 1.60) for psychosis. No consistent long-term risk was seen, with meta-analytic HRs of 0.94 (95% CI 0.71, 1.26) for depression, 0.77 (95% CI 0.56, 1.07) for suicide/suicidal ideation and 0.99 (95% CI 0.72, 1.35) for psychosis.\n\nHCQ as used to treat RA does not appear to increase the risk of depression, suicide/suicidal ideation or psychosis compared with SSZ. No effects were seen in the short or long term. Use at a higher dose or for different indications needs further investigation.\n\nRegistered with EU PAS (reference no.

To serve this purpose, the authors conducted semi-structured interviews with managers and employees in eight telemedicine companies. The analysis of the empirical data confirmed the importance of digital visits and their efficiency. The potential of digital visits is expected to increase significantly, should they make use of remote devices to transfer real-time data from patients to physicians. In such a case, digital visits are expected to cover approximately 70-75% of medical cases. However, the use of remote devices must be taken with caution and specific conditions need to be taken into account.

This study aimed to analyse the role of these skills in the emotional response of health professionals to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBefore the COVID-19 outbreak, 48 doctors and 48 nurses participated in a simulation-based teamwork training program based on teaching non-technical skills through simulation. In May 2020, this group of professionals from a COVID-19 referral hospital was invited to participate in a survey exploring stress, anxiety, and depression, using the PSS-14 (Perceived Stress Scale) and the HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) measures. A control group that did not receive the training was included. We conducted a logistic regression to assess whether having attended a simulation-based teamwork training program modified the probability of presenting psychological distress (PSS-14 > 18 or HADS> 12).\n\nA total of 141 healthcare professionals were included, 77 in the intervention group and 64 in the control group. Based on the PSS-14, 70.1% of the intervention group and 75% of the control group (p = 0.342) had symptoms of stress.

SARS-CoV-2 has a predilection for the pulmonary system and can result in serious pneumonia necessitating hospitalisation. Computed tomography (CT) chest scans of patients with severe symptoms, show signs of multifocal bilateral ground or ground-glass opacities (GGO) associated with consolidation areas with patchy distribution. However, it is less well known that both asymptomatic and mild symptomatic patients may exhibit similar lung changes. Presumably, the various pathological changes in the lungs may increase the risk of adverse events during diving (e.g., lung barotrauma, pulmonary oedema, etc.), thus these lung manifestations need to be considered prior to allowing resumption of diving. Presently, it is not known how the structural changes in the lungs develop and to what extent they resolve, in particular in asymptomatic carriers and patients with mild disease. However, current evidence indicates that a month of recovery may be too short an interval to guarantee complete pulmonary restitution even after COVID-19 infections not demanding hospital care.", "doi": "10.28920/dhm50.4.413-416", "pmid": "33325024", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-21T10:00:27.634Z", "modified": "2021-01-10T18:14:36.428Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "5896670bf8704d568137c3fb607add22", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/5896670bf8704d568137c3fb607add22.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/5896670bf8704d568137c3fb607add22"}}, "title": "Effects on Gambling Activity From Coronavirus Disease 2019-An Analysis of Revenue-Based Taxation of Online- and Land-Based Gambling Operators During the Pandemic.", "authors": [{"family": "H\u00e5kansson", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-12-17", "journal": {"title": "Front Psychiatry", "issn": "1664-0640", "volume": "11", "issue": null, "pages": "611939", "issn-l": "1664-0640"}, "abstract": "Background: Concerns have been raised about increased gambling problems during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis, particularly in settings with high online gambling and risks of migration from land-based to riskier online-based gambling types. However, few non-self-reported data sources are hitherto available. The present study aimed to assess changes in the online- and land-based gambling markets in Sweden during the first months affected by the societal impact of COVID-19. Methods: Data were derived from national authority data describing monthly taxations of all licensed Swedish gambling operators, whose monthly tax payments are directly based on gambling revenue. Subdivisions of the gambling market were followed monthly from before COVID-19 onset in Sweden (mainly February 2020) through June 2020, when the sports market was restarted after COVID-19 lockdown. Results: Overall revenue-based taxations in the licensed gambling decreased markedly from February to March, but stabilized onto an overall modest decrease through June. Commercial online casino/betting, despite some decrease in March, was maintained on a relatively stable level through June. However, within this category, horse betting increased steeply during the pandemic but returned to prepandemic levels later during the period. The state-owned operator in betting/online casino decreased markedly throughout the pandemic. The remaining commercial operators, mainly in online casino and online betting, demonstrated no change during the pandemic and ended on a June level 14% above the February level. Throughout the pandemic, the smaller restaurant casinos decreased markedly, while major state-owned casinos also closed entirely. State-owned lotteries and electronic gambling machines decreased markedly but were rapidly normalized to prepandemic levels. Conclusions: Commercial online gambling operators' revenues remained stable throughout the pandemic, despite the dramatic lockdown in sports. Thus, chance-based online games may have remained a strong actor in the gambling market despite the COVID-19 crisis, in line with previous self-report data. A sudden increase in horse betting during the sports lockdown and its decrease when sports reopened confirm the picture of possible COVID-19-related migration between gambling types, indicating a volatility with potential impact on gambling-related public health.", "doi": "10.3389/fpsyt.2020.611939", "pmid": "33391059", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Public Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7773659"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-01-05T15:18:01.702Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:46:59.964Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "90e7835a18214ccabf92e7659c5a9709", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/90e7835a18214ccabf92e7659c5a9709.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/90e7835a18214ccabf92e7659c5a9709"}}, "title": "Shared genetic etiology between idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and COVID-19 severity", "authors": [{"family": "Fadista", "given": "Joao", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Kraven", "given": "Luke M", "initials": "LM"}, {"family": "Karjalainen", "given": "Juha", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Andrews", "given": "Shea J", "initials": "SJ"}, {"family": "Geller", "given": "Frank", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Baillie", "given": "J Kenneth", "initials": "JK"}, {"family": "Wain", "given": "Louise V", "initials": "LV"}, {"family": "Gisli Jenkins", "given": "R", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Feenstra", "given": "Bjarke", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "None", "given": "", "initials": ""}], "type": "posted-content", "published": "2020-12-16", "journal": {"title": "EBioMedicine", "issn": "2352-3964", "issn-l": null, "volume": "65", "issue": null, "pages": "103277"}, "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a complex lung disease, characterized by progressive lung scarring. Severe COVID-19 is associated with substantial pneumonitis and has a number of shared major risk factors with IPF. This study aimed to determine the genetic correlation between IPF and severe COVID-19 and assess a potential causal role of genetically increased risk of IPF on COVID-19 severity.\n\nThe genetic correlation between IPF and COVID-19 severity was estimated with linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression. We performed a Mendelian randomization (MR) study for IPF causality in COVID-19. Genetic variants associated with IPF susceptibility (P<5 \u00d7 10 -8) in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were used as instrumental variables (IVs). Effect estimates of those IVs on COVID-19 severity were gathered from the GWAS meta-analysis by the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (4,336 cases & 623,902 controls).\n\nWe detected a positive genetic correlation of IPF with COVID-19 severity (rg=0\u00b731 [95% CI 0\u00b704-0\u00b757], P = 0\u00b7023). The MR estimates for severe COVID-19 did not reveal any genetic association (OR 1\u00b705, [95% CI 0\u00b792-1\u00b720], P = 0\u00b743). However, outlier analysis revealed that the IPF risk allele rs35705950 at MUC5B had a different effect compared with the other variants. When rs35705950 was excluded, MR results provided evidence that genetically increased risk of IPF has a causal effect on COVID-19 severity (OR 1\u00b721, [95% CI 1\u00b706-1\u00b738], P = 4\u00b724 \u00d7 10 -3). Furthermore, the IPF risk-allele at MUC5B showed an apparent protective effect against COVID-19 hospitalization only in older adults (OR 0\u00b786, [95% CI 0\u00b773-1\u00b700], P = 2\u00b799 \u00d7 10-2) .\n\nThe strongest genetic determinant of IPF, rs35705950 at MUC5B, seems to confer protection against COVID-19, whereas the combined effect of all other IPF risk loci seem to confer risk of COVID-19 severity. The observed effect of rs35705950 could either be due to protective effects of mucin over-production on the airways or a consequence of selection bias due to (1) a patient group that is heavily enriched for the rs35705950 T undertaking strict self-isolation and/or (2) due to survival bias of the rs35705950 non-IPF risk allele carriers. Due to the diverse impact of IPF causal variants on SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a possible selection bias as an explanation, further investigation is needed to address this apparent paradox between variance at MUC5B and other IPF genetic risk factors.\n\nNovo Nordisk Foundation and Oak Foundation.", "doi": "10.1101/2020.12.15.20248279", "pmid": "33714028", "labels": {"Category: Genomics & transcriptomics": null, "Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "URL", "key": "https://github.com/genomicsITER/PFgenetics", "description": "Variant summary data available on request"}, {"db": "URL", "key": "https://www.covid19hg.org/results/", "description": "COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (HGI) GWAS metaanalysis"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-01-07T16:51:10.098Z", "modified": "2021-03-22T11:47:53.524Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "343607ba24654e4c81bcf4e66035a688", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/343607ba24654e4c81bcf4e66035a688.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/343607ba24654e4c81bcf4e66035a688"}}, "title": "Large differences in community COVID-19 testing across geographic areas in a Swedish region with 385,000 inhabitants", "authors": [{"family": "Kennedy", "given": "Beatrice", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Martinell", "given": "Mats", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Hammar", "given": "Ulf", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "van Zoest", "given": "Vera", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Kristiansson", "given": "Robert S", "initials": "RS"}, {"family": "Fitipaldi", "given": "Hugo", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Tsereteli", "given": "Neli", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Varotsis", "given": "Georgios", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Dekkers", "given": "Koen", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Bjork", "given": "Jonas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Fall", "given": "Tove", "initials": "T"}], "type": "posted-content", "published": "2020-12-16", "journal": {"title": "medRxiv", "issn": null, "issn-l": null, "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1101/2020.12.15.20248247", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Type: Preprint": null, "Funder: Vinnova": null, "Category: Public Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "NA", "key": "Available on request", "description": null}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-18T07:46:23.709Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:46:59.897Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "ec3217761ddc48da86f7a92d820c9dbf", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/ec3217761ddc48da86f7a92d820c9dbf.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/ec3217761ddc48da86f7a92d820c9dbf"}}, "title": "A blueprint for high affinity SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors from activity-based compound library screening guided by analysis of protein dynamics", "authors": [{"family": "Gossen", "given": "Jonas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Albani", "given": "Simone", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Hanke", "given": "Anton", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Joseph", "given": "Benjamin P", "initials": "BP"}, {"family": "Bergh", "given": "Cathrine", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Kuzikov", "given": "Maria", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Costanzi", "given": "Elisa", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Manelfi", "given": "Candida", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Storici", "given": "Paola", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Gribbon", "given": "Philip", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Beccari", "given": "Andrea R", "initials": "AR"}, {"family": "Talarico", "given": "Carmine", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Spyrakis", "given": "Francesca", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Lindahl", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Zaliani", "given": "Andrea", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Carloni", "given": "Paolo", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Wade", "given": "Rebecca C", "initials": "RC"}, {"family": "Musiani", "given": "Francesco", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Kokh", "given": "Daria B", "initials": "DB"}, {"family": "Rossetti", "given": "Giulia", "initials": "G"}], "type": "posted-content", "published": "2020-12-15", "journal": {"title": "bioRxiv", "issn": null, "issn-l": null, "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": null}, "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak continues to spread at a rapid rate worldwide. The main protease (Mpro) is an attractive target for anti-COVID-19 agents. Unfortunately, unexpected difficulties have been encountered in the design of specific inhibitors. Here, by analyzing an ensemble of ~30,000 SARS-CoV-2 Mpro conformations from crystallographic studies and molecular simulations, we show that small structural variations in the binding site dramatically impact ligand binding properties. Hence, traditional druggability indices fail to adequately discriminate between highly and poorly druggable conformations of the binding site. By performing ~200 virtual screenings of compound libraries on selected protein structures, we redefine the protein\u2019s druggability as the consensus chemical space arising from the multiple conformations of the binding site formed upon ligand binding. This procedure revealed a unique SARS-CoV-2 Mpro blueprint that led to a definition of a specific structure-based pharmacophore. The latter explains the poor transferability of potent SARS-CoV Mpro inhibitors to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, despite the identical sequences of the active sites. Importantly, application of the pharmacophore predicted novel high affinity inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, that were validated by in vitro assays performed here and by a newly solved X-ray crystal structure.

Creating equitable access to mainstream health and healthcare services and ensuring inclusive health responses remain a means of addressing health inequities and disparities. In this article, we argue on the need for inclusive responses to public health emergencies in Africa using COVID-19 as a case example. Africa's response to public health emergencies needs to recognize that for every marginalized/vulnerable group, it is important to strategize to address their particular needs in such a way to surmount any barrier to the right to health. For Africa's public health response to be more inclusive, we therefore need to be more strategic and proactive in reaching out to specific groups and to identify and address their needs.

The following clinical problems were identified as having increased 'a lot': anxiety 82% (n=1486); diabetes distress 65% (n=1189); depression 49% (n= 893); acute hyperglycaemia 39% (n=710); and foot complications 17% (n=323). Forty-seven percent (n=771) of respondents identified that the level of care provided to people with diabetes had declined either extremely or quite severely. Self-management support, diabetes education and psychological support were rated by diabetes nurse respondents as having declined extremely or quite severely during the COVID-19 pandemic by 31% (n=499), 63% (n=1,027) and 34% (n=551), respectively.\n\nThe findings show that diabetes nurses across Europe have seen significant increases in both physical and psychological problems in their patient populations during COVID-19. The data also show that clinical diabetes services have been significantly disrupted. As the COVID-19 situation continues we need to adapt care systems with some urgency to minimise the impact of the pandemic on the diabetes population.", "doi": "10.1111/dme.14498", "pmid": "33314244",

"abstract": "Background: Countries have introduced a variety of measures to prevent and treat COVID-19 with medicines and personal protective equipment (PPE), with some countries adopting preventative strategies earlier than others. However, there has been considerable controversy surrounding some treatments. This includes hydroxychloroquine where the initial hype and misinformation lead to shortages, price rises and suicides. Price rises and shortages have also been seen for PPE. Such activities can have catastrophic effects on patients where there are high co-payment levels and issues of affordability. Consequently, there is a need to investigate this further. Objective: Assess changes in the availability, utilization and prices of relevant medicines and PPE during the pandemic among a range of Asian countries. Our approach: Narrative literature review combined with interviews among community pharmacists to assess changes in consumption, prices and shortages of medicines and PPE from the beginning of March 2020 until end of May 2020. In addition, suggestions on ways to reduce misinformation. Results: 308 pharmacists took part from five Asian countries. There was an appreciable increase in the utilization of antimicrobials in Pakistan (in over 88% of pharmacies), with lower increases or no change in Bangladesh, India, Malaysia and Vietnam. Encouragingly, there was increased use of vitamins/immune boosters and PPE across the countries, as well as limited price rises for antimicrobials in India, Malaysia and Vietnam, although greater price rises seen for analgesics and vitamin C/immune boosters. Appreciable price increases were also seen for PPE across some countries. Conclusion: Encouraging to see increases in utilization of vitamins/immune boosters and PPE. However, increases in the utilization and prices of antimicrobials is a concern that needs addressing alongside misinformation and any unintended consequences from the pandemic. Community pharmacists can play a key role in providing evidence-based advice, helping to moderate prices, as well as helping address some of the unintended consequences of the pandemic.", "doi": "10.3389/fpubh.2020.585832", "pmid": "33381485", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Public Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7767884"}, {"db": "NA", "key": "Available on request", "description": null}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-01-07T12:08:28.441Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:46:59.826Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "55331c5e35f74d09a14cbe3534f72131", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/55331c5e35f74d09a14cbe3534f72131.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/55331c5e35f74d09a14cbe3534f72131"}}, "title": "Possible Transmission Flow of SARS-CoV-2 Based on ACE2 Features.", "authors": [{"family": "Hassan", "given": "Sk Sarif", "initials": "SS"}, {"family": "Ghosh", "given": "Shinjini", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Attrish", "given": "Diksha", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Choudhury", "given": "Pabitra Pal", "initials": "PP"}, {"family": "Aljabali", "given": "Alaa A A", "initials": "AAA"}, {"family": "Uhal", "given": "Bruce D", "initials": "BD"}, {"family": "Lundstrom", "given": "Kenneth", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Rezaei", "given": "Nima", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Uversky", "given": "Vladimir N", "initials": "VN"}, {"family": "Seyran", "given": "Murat", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Pizzol", "given": "Damiano", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Adadi", "given": "Parise", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Soares", "given": "Antonio", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "El-Aziz", "given": "Tarek Mohamed Abd", "initials": "TMA"}, {"family": "Kandimalla", "given": "Ramesh", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Tambuwala", "given": "Murtaza M", "initials": "MM"}, {"family": "Azad", "given": "Gajendra Kumar", "initials": "GK"}, {"family": "Sherchan", "given": "Samendra P", "initials": "SP"}, {"family": "Baetas-da-Cruz", "given": "Wagner", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Takayama", "given": "Kazuo", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Serrano-Aroca", "given": "\u00c1ngel", "initials": "\u00c1"}, {"family": "Chauhan", "given": "Gaurav", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Palu", "given": "Giorgio", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Brufsky", "given": "Adam M", "initials": "AM"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-12-13", "journal": {"title": "Molecules", "issn": "1420-3049", "volume": "25", "issue": "24", "pages": "5906", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular receptor for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is engendering the severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

These subjects develop local and systemic hyper-inflammation, which are associated with thrombotic complications and multi-organ failure. Therefore, understanding SARS-CoV-2 induced hyper-inflammation in elderly men is a pressing need. Here we focus on the role of extracellular DNA, mainly mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and telomeric DNA (telDNA) in the modulation of systemic inflammation in these subjects. In particular, extracellular mtDNA is regarded as a powerful trigger of the inflammatory response. On the contrary, extracellular telDNA pool is estimated to be capable of inhibiting a variety of inflammatory pathways. In turn, we underpin that telDNA reservoir is progressively depleted during aging, and that it is scarcer in men than in women. We propose that an increase in extracellular mtDNA, concomitant with the reduction of the anti-inflammatory telDNA reservoir may explain hyper-inflammation in elderly male affected by COVID-19. This scenario is reminiscent of inflamm-aging, the portmanteau word that depicts how aging and aging related diseases are intimately linked to inflammation.", "doi": "10.1016/j.arr.2020.101234", "pmid": "33321254", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S1568-1637(20)30369-X"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-21T10:05:39.471Z", "modified": "2021-01-10T18:17:21.167Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "353c836a008149b6b1884eaf9e5c3dcb", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/353c836a008149b6b1884eaf9e5c3dcb.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/353c836a008149b6b1884eaf9e5c3dcb"}}, "title": "The MERS-CoV receptor gene is among COVID-19 risk factors inherited from Neandertals", "authors": [{"family": "Zeberg", "given": "Hugo", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Paabo", "given": "Svante", "initials": "S"}], "type": "posted-content", "published": "2020-12-12", "journal": {"title": "bioRxiv", "issn": null, "issn-l": null, "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1101/2020.12.11.422139", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Type: Preprint": null, "Category: Genomics & transcriptomics": null, "Category: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "URL", "key": "http://cdna.eva.mpg.de/neandertal/Vindija/VCF/", "description": "Croatian Neandertal genome"}, {"db": "URL", "key": "https://bioinf.eva.mpg.de/jbrowse/", "description": "Croatian Neandertal genome"}, {"db": "URL", "key": "http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/", "description": "Modern human genomes at the 1000 Genomes Project"}, {"db": "URL", "key": "https://www.covid19hg.org/results/", "description": "GWAS summary statistics (round 4 release: A/B2_ALL_eur_leave_23andme)"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-01-08T08:41:17.454Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:46:13.031Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "ec1877b0d29b4867afe2f155af937d3b", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/ec1877b0d29b4867afe2f155af937d3b.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/ec1877b0d29b4867afe2f155af937d3b"}}, "title": "Virtual and In Vitro Antiviral Screening Revive Therapeutic Drugs for COVID-19", "authors": [{"family": "Bocci", "given": "Giovanni", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Bradfute", "given": "Steven B", "initials": "SB"}, {"family": "Ye", "given": "Chunyan", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Garcia", "given": "Matthew J", "initials": "MJ"}, {"family": "Parvathareddy", "given": "Jyothi", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Reichard", "given": "Walter", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Surendranathan", "given": "Surekha", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Bansal", "given": "Shruti", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Bologa", "given": "Cristian G", "initials": "CG"}, {"family": "Perkins", "given": "Douglas J", "initials": "DJ"}, {"family": "Jonsson", "given": "Colleen B", "initials": "CB"}, {"family": "Sklar", "given": "Larry A", "initials": "LA"}, {"family": "Oprea", "given": "Tudor I", "initials": "TI"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2020-12-11", "journal": {"title": "ACS Pharmacol.

Here we report new potential therapeutics for COVID-19 identified with a combined virtual and experimental screening strategy and selected among already approved drugs. We used hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), one of the most studied drugs in current clinical trials, as a reference template to screen for structural similarity against a library of almost 4000 approved drugs. The top-ranked drugs, based on structural similarity to HCQ, were selected for in vitro antiviral assessment. Among the selected drugs, both zuclopenthixol and nebivolol efficiently block SARS-CoV-2 infection with EC50 values in the low micromolar range, as confirmed by independent experiments. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential of ambroxol, amodiaquine, and its active metabolite (N-monodesethyl amodiaquine) is also discussed. In trying to understand the \"hydroxychloroquine\" mechanism of action, both pKa and the HCQ aromatic core may play a role. Further, we show that the amodiaquine metabolite and, to a lesser extent, zuclopenthixol and nebivolol are active in a SARS-CoV-2 titer reduction assay. Given the need for improved efficacy and safety, we propose zuclopenthixol, nebivolol, and amodiaquine as potential candidates for clinical trials against the early phase of the SARS-CoV-2 infection

We identify and replicate novel genome-wide significant associations, on chr12q24.13 (rs10735079, p=1.65 [Formula: see text] 10-8) in a gene cluster encoding antiviral restriction enzyme activators (OAS1, OAS2, OAS3), on chr19p13.2 (rs2109069, p=2.3 [Formula: see text] 10-12) near the gene encoding tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), on chr19p13.3 (rs2109069, p=3.98 [Formula: see text] 10-12) within the gene encoding dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9), and on chr21q22.1 (rs2236757, p=4.99 [Formula: see text] 10-8) in the interferon receptor gene IFNAR2. We identify potential targets for repurposing of licensed medications: using Mendelian randomisation we found evidence in support of a causal link from low expression of IFNAR2, and high expression of TYK2, to life-threatening disease; transcriptome-wide association in lung tissue revealed that high expression of the monocyte/macrophage chemotactic receptor CCR2 is associated with severe Covid-19. Our results identify robust genetic signals relating to key host antiviral defence mechanisms, and mediators of inflammatory organ damage in Covid-19. Both mechanisms may be amenable to targeted treatment with existing drugs.

We compared the ability of the different constructs to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus and infectious virus in neutralization assays.

To avoid the risk of viral-exposure of laboratory workers, thermal inactivation is currently recommended but has unknown effects on the accuracy of the rRT-PCR results. Thirty-six NP/OP specimens were collected from COVID-19 patients and subjected to thermal inactivation (60\u00b0C for 30 min) or the RNA extraction processes to activate the form.

There is limited information about prognostic markers that could help clinicians to identify COVID-19 patients with a poor prognosis. Serum levels of the immune activation marker neopterin has shown to be of prognostic value in patients with SARS. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serum neopterin is associated with the severity of COVID-19. Methods We included 34 patients with confirmed COVID-19 between March 3 and March 30, 2020. Fifteen patients had mild disease and did not require hospitalization, whereas 19 patients developed severe COVID-19 requiring intensive care. Concentrations of serum neopterin, tryptophan, and kynurenine were measured at and repeatedly after inclusion. Results We found a more than two-fold higher mean concentration of neopterin in severely ill patients (mean value 42.0 nmol/L (SD 18.2)) compared to patients with mild symptoms (16.9 nmol/L (SD 11.0)). All of the severe cases had elevated neopterin concentrations (>9.1 nmol/L) at the initial sampling with values ranging from 17.2 to 86.7 nmol/L. In comparison, 10 of 15 patients with mild disease had neopterin levels above 9.1 nmol/L, with concentrations in the range from 4.9 to 31.6 nmol/L. Neopterin levels gradually decreased during the course of COVID-19, but severe cases maintained elevated levels for a longer period. Moreover, lower levels of tryptophan and higher levels of kynurenine, indicating an increased tryptophan catabolism, were seen in the group with severe cases. Conclusions In conclusion, we found that serum neopterin levels are associated with the severity of COVID-19.

Native gel electrophoresis demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to LPS. Microscale thermophoresis yielded a KD of \u223c47 nM for the interaction. Computational modeling and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations further substantiated the experimental results, identifying a main LPS binding site in SARS-CoV-2 S protein.

The in vitro inflammatory response was further validated by employing NF-\u03baB reporter mice and in vivo bioimaging.

The strength of PHEIC declarations is the ability to rapidly mobilize international coordination, streamline funding and accelerate the advancement of the development of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics under emergency use authorization.

The HemoScreen is found to correlate well to laser and impedance-based methods while emphasis is given to mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), and platelets (PLT) that demonstrate better correlation when the vision-based method is compared to itself due to the essential differences between the underlying technologies.\n\nThe HemoScreen analyzer demonstrates lab equivalent performance, tested at different clinical settings and sample characteristics, and might outperform standard techniques in the presence of certain interferences. This new approach to hematology testing has great potential to improve quality of care in a variety of settings.", "doi": "10.1093/jalm/jfaa186", "pmid": "33274357", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "6020101"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-06T07:07:57.964Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:46:13.585Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "e76a6c0b95dc43c883950fbdbb497773", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/e76a6c0b95dc43c883950fbdbb497773.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/e76a6c0b95dc43c883950fbdbb497773"}}, "title": "Responsible Gambling Telephone Intervention to High-Risk Gamblers by a State-Owned Gambling Operator in Sweden: Study Protocol for a Study on Effectiveness, User Satisfaction, and Acceptability.", "authors": [{"family": "H\u00e5kansson", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Franklin", "given": "Katja", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Dahlstr\u00f6m", "given": "Maria", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Lyckberg", "given": "Axel", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-12-04", "journal": {"title": "Int J Environ Res Public Health", "issn": "1660-4601", "volume": "17", "issue": "23", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Gambling disorder is associated with severe financial, social, and psychological consequences, but treatment-seeking rates have been described to be low. Apart from formal treatment, motivational interventions in nontreatment-seeking high-risk gamblers have been shown to be promising.

Early experiences of such interventions are limited by the risk that gambling in individuals reached with the intervention may continue with a different gambling operator. The present study aims to evaluate effectiveness and user acceptability of a responsible gambling intervention continuously carried out by the Swedish state-owned gambling operator Svenska Spel Sport & Casino. This intervention for high-risk gamblers, identified either through substantial monetary losses or through a voluntary self-test by the gambler, includes a motivational telephone intervention aiming to encourage the gambler to set deposit limits, practice self-exclusion, or seek help.

The empirical results showed that risk perception was highly asymmetric across geographical regions. Enterprises with longer cash flow coverage periods and higher values of total assets perceived significantly lower risk levels, as cash and assets functioned as a buffer against the impact of COVID-19. The findings of the study imply that the \"just-in-time\" approach and the absence of a proactive and preventative stance to risk management reduced the resilience of agri-food SMEs to the risks presented by the pandemic. Generally, enterprises that operate both in domestic and export markets perceived lower COVID-19 risks. Finally, the main export destination to which the surveyed enterprises export was a significant determinant of their risk perception. These findings could be useful to managers of agri-food businesses in terms of better understanding of risks and promotion of risk management practices.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitude and effects of misinformation about COVID-19 on anxiety level among the general public residing in Jordan. This cross-sectional study was conducted using an online-based questionnaire that took place in April 2020, which targeted people residing in Jordan, aged 18 and above. The questionnaire included items on the following: demographic characteristics of the participants, knowledge about COVID-19, anxiety level and misconceptions regarding the origin of the pandemic. The total number of participants included in final analysis was 3150. The study population was predominantly females (76.0%), with mean age of 31 years. The overall knowledge of COVID-19 was satisfactory. Older age, males, lower monthly income and educational levels, smoking and history of chronic disease were associated with perceiving COVID-19 as a very dangerous disease. Variables that were associated with a higher anxiety level during the pandemic included: lower monthly income and educational level, residence outside the capital (Amman) and history of smoking. Misinformation about the origin of the pandemic (being part of a conspiracy, biologic warfare and the 5G networks role) was also associated with higher anxiety levels.

Beginning on April 28, in England, the Department of Health and Social Care allocated RT-PCR tests for COVID-19 to app users who logged themselves as healthy at least once in 9 days and then reported any symptom. We calculated incidence of COVID-19 using the invited swab (RT-PCR) tests reported in the app, and we estimated prevalence using a symptom-based method (using logistic regression) and a method based on both symptoms and swab test results. We used incidence rates to estimate the effective reproduction number, R(t), modelling the system as a Poisson process and using Markov Chain Monte-Carlo. We used three datasets to validate our models: the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Community Infection Survey, the Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT-1) study, and UK Government testing data. We used geographically granular estimates to highlight regions with rapidly increasing case numbers, or hotspots.\r\n\r\nFrom March 24 to Sept 29, 2020, a total of 2&emsp14;873&emsp14;726 users living in England signed up to use the app, of whom 2&emsp14;842&emsp14;732 (98&middot;9%) provided valid age information and daily assessments. These users provided a total of 120&emsp14;192&emsp14;306 daily reports of their symptoms, and recorded the results of 169&emsp14;682 invited swab tests. On a national level, our estimates of incidence and prevalence showed a similar sensitivity to changes to those reported in the ONS and REACT-1 studies. On Sept 28, 2020, we estimated an incidence of 15&emsp14;841 (95% CI 14&emsp14;023&ndash;17&emsp14;885) daily cases, a prevalence of 0&middot;53% (0&middot;45&ndash;0&middot;60), and R(t) of 1&middot;17 (1&middot;15&ndash;1&middot;19) in England. On a geographically granular level, on Sept 28, 2020, we detected 15 (75%) of the 20 regions with highest incidence according to government test data.\r\n\r\nOur method could help to detect rapid case increases in regions where government testing provision is lower.

This structural snapshot describes the structural bases underlying the pandemic capacity of SARS-CoV-2 and explains its fast motion over respiratory epithelia that allow its rapid cellular entry. Based on notable viral spike (S) protein features, we propose that the flat sialic acid-binding domain at the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S1 subunit leads to more effective first contact and interaction with the sialic acid layer over the epithelium and this, in turn, allows faster viral \"surfing\" of the epithelium and receptor scanning by SARS-CoV-2. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) protein on the epithelial surface is the primary entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and protein-protein interaction assays demonstrate high-affinity binding of the S protein to ACE-2. To date, no high-frequency mutations were detected at the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the S1 subunit in the S protein, where the receptor-binding domain (RBD) is located. Tight binding to ACE-2 by a conserved viral RBD suggests the ACE2-RBD interaction is likely optimal.

A computational work was performed for locating the potential electrostatic interaction sites between kaolinite aluminol and siloxane surfaces and the residues of this protein-fragment ligand, monitoring the possible conformational changes. This hydrated neutralized kaolinite/protein-fragment system was simulated by means of molecular modeling based on atomistic force fields based on empirical interatomic potentials and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The MD calculations indicated that the studied protein-fragment interacted with the kaolinite surfaces with an exothermic process and structural distortions were observed, particularly with the hydrophilic aluminol surface by favorable adsorption energy. The viral units isolation or trapping by the adsorption on the kaolinite nanoparticles producing structural distortion of the peptide ligands could lead to the blockage of the entry on the receptor and hence a lack of viral activity would be produced. Therefore, these findings with the proposed insights could be an useful information for the next experimental and development studies in the area of discovering inhibitors of the global challenged hepatitis and other pathogenic viruses based on the phyllosilicate surface activity.

Although primarily affecting the lungs, the SARS-CoV-2 virus also affects the cardiovascular system. In addition to cardiac effects, e.g. myocarditis, arrhythmias, and myocardial damage, the vasculature is affected in COVID-19, both directly by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and indirectly as a result of a systemic inflammatory cytokine storm. This includes the role of the vascular endothelium in the recruitment of inflammatory leucocytes where they contribute to tissue damage and cytokine release, which are key drivers of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), in disseminated intravascular coagulation, and cardiovascular complications in COVID-19. There is also evidence linking endothelial cells (ECs) to SARS-CoV-2 infection including: (i) the expression and function of its receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the vasculature; (ii) the prevalence of a Kawasaki disease-like syndrome (vasculitis) in COVID-19; and (iii) evidence of EC infection with SARS-CoV-2 in patients with fatal COVID-19. Here, the Working Group on Atherosclerosis and Vascular Biology together with the Council of Basic Cardiovascular Science of the European Society of Cardiology provide a Position Statement on the importance of the endothelium in the underlying pathophysiology behind the clinical presentation in COVID-19 and identify key questions for future research to address. We propose that endothelial biomarkers and tests of function (e.g. flow-mediated dilatation) should be evaluated for their usefulness in the risk stratification of COVID-19 patients. A better understanding of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on endothelial biology in both the micro- and macrovasculature is required, and endothelial function testing should be considered in the follow-up of convalescent COVID-19 patients for early detection of long-term cardiovascular complications.", "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvaa230", "pmid": "32750108", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "5880580"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7454368"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-07T15:56:02.856Z", "modified": "2020-12-07T15:56:02.880Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "447cc7afc9f745eba4a64bd311f4a71e", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/447cc7afc9f745eba4a64bd311f4a71e.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/447cc7afc9f745eba4a64bd311f4a71e"}}, "title": "Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic on Patients with Primary Immunodeficiency.", "authors": [{"family": "Delavari", "given": "Samaneh", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Abolhassani", "given": "Hassan", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Abolnezhadian", "given": "Farhad", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Babaha", "given": "Fateme", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Iranparast", "given": "Sara", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Ahanchian", "given": "Hamid", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Moazzen", "given": "Nasrin", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Nabavi", "given": "Mohammad", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Arshi", "given": "Saba", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Fallahpour", "given": "Morteza", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Bemanian", "given": "Mohammad Hassan", "initials": "MH"}, {"family": "Shokri", "given": "Sima", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Momen", "given": "Tooba", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Sadeghi-Shabestari", "given": "Mahnaz", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Molatefi", "given": "Rasol", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Shirkani", "given": "Afshin", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Vosughimotlagh", "given": "Ahmad", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Safarirad", "given": "Molood", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Sharifzadeh", "given": "Meisam", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Pashangzadeh", "given": "Salar", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Salami", "given": "Fereshte", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Shirmast", "given": "Paniz", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Rezaei", "given": "Arezou", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Moeini Shad", "given": "Tannaz", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Mohraz", "given": "Minoo", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Rezaei", "given": "Nima", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Hammarstr\u00f6m", "given": "Lennart", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Yazdani", "given": "Reza", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Aghamohamamdi", "given": "Asghar", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-12-01", "journal": {"title": "J Clin Immunol", "issn": "1573-2592", "issn-l": "0271-9142", "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": null}, "abstract": "Although it is estimated that COVID-19 life-threatening conditions may be diagnosed in less than 1:1000 infected individuals below the age of 50, but the real impact of this pandemic on pediatric patients with different types of primary immunodeficiency (PID) is not elucidated.

This is especially important in real-time surveillance, where the aim is to gain situational awareness, for example, if cases are currently increasing or decreasing. Reporting delays between disease onset and case reporting hamper our ability to understand the dynamics of an epidemic close to now when looking at the number of daily reported cases only. Nowcasting can be used to adjust daily case counts for occurred-but-not-yet-reported events. Here, we present a novel application of nowcasting to data on the current COVID-19 pandemic in Bavaria. It is based on a hierarchical Bayesian model that considers changes in the reporting delay distribution over time and associated with the weekday of reporting. Furthermore, we present a way to estimate the effective time-varying case reproduction number based on predictions of the nowcast. The approaches are based on previously published work, that we considerably extended and adapted to the current task of nowcasting COVID-19 cases. We provide methodological details of the developed approach, illustrate results based on data of the current pandemic, and evaluate the model based on synthetic and retrospective data on COVID-19 in Bavaria. Results of our nowcasting are reported to the Bavarian health authority and published on a webpage on a daily basis (https://corona.stat.uni-muenchen.de/). Code and synthetic data for the analysis are available from https://github.com/FelixGuenther/nc_covid19_bavaria and can be used for adaption of our approach to different data.

Adverse outcomes with COVID-19 have been linked to cytokine storm but the most effective way to address exaggerated inflammatory response is complex and unclear. The Expert Working Group on the Commission of Human Medicines in the UK and other organizations have stated that there is insufficient evidence to establish a link between ibuprofen and susceptibility to or exacerbation of COVID-19. NSAID use must also be categorized by whether the drugs are relatively low-dose over-the-counter oral products taken occasionally versus higher-dose or parenteral NSAIDs. Even if evidence emerged arguing for or against NSAIDs in this setting, it is unclear if this evidence would apply to all NSAIDs at all doses in all dosing regimens. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) has been proposed as an alternative to NSAIDs but there are issues with liver toxicity at high doses. There are clearly COVID-19 cases where NSAIDs should not be used, but there is no strong evidence that NSAIDs must be avoided in all patients with COVID-19; clinicians must weigh these choices on an individual basis.", "doi": "10.1007/s40122-020-00173-5", "pmid": "32447629", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1007/s40122-020-00173-5"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7245573"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-25T09:13:50.558Z", "modified": "2020-11-30T09:03:27.305Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "eacb488d3071417b9b63d43c96028d43", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/eacb488d3071417b9b63d43c96028d43.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/eacb488d3071417b9b63d43c96028d43"}}, "title": "A systematic review and meta-analysis of the use of renin-angiotensin system drugs and COVID-19 clinical outcomes: What is the evidence so far?", "authors": [{"family": "Kurdi", "given": "Amanj", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Abutheraa", "given": "Nouf", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Akil", "given": "Lina", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Godman", "given": "Brian", "initials": "B"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-12-00", "journal": {"title": "Pharmacol Res Perspect", "issn": "2052-1707", "volume": "8", "issue": "6", "pages": "e00666", "issn-l": "2052-1707"}, "abstract": "Conflicting evidence exists about the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) on COVID-19 clinical outcomes. We aimed to provide a comprehensive/updated evaluation of the effect of ACEIs/ARBs on COVID-19-related clinical outcomes, including exploration of interclass differences between ACEIs and ARBs, using a systematic review/meta-analysis approach conducted in Medline (OVID), Embase, Scopus, Cochrane library, and medRxiv from inception to 22 May 2020. English studies that evaluated the effect of ACEIs/ARBs among patients with COVID-19 were included. Studies' quality was appraised using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data were analyzed using the random-effects modeling stratified by exposure (ACEIs/ARBs, ACEIs, and ARBs). Heterogeneiity was assessed using I 2 statistic. Several subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the impact of potential confounders. Overall, 27 studies were eligible. The pooled analyses showed nonsignificant associations between ACEIs/ARBs and death (OR:0.97, 95%CI:0.75,1.27), ICU admission (OR:1.09;95%CI:0.65,1.81), death/ICU admission (OR:0.67; 95%CI:0.52,0.86), risk of COVID-19 infection (OR:1.01; 95%CI:0.93,1.10), severe infection (OR:0.78; 95%CI:0.53,1.15), and hospitalization (OR:1.15; 95%CI:0.81,1.65). However, the subgroup analyses indicated significant association between ACEIs/ARBs and hospitalization among USA studies (OR:1.59; 95%CI:1.03,2.44), peer-reviewed (OR:1.93, 95%CI:1.38,2.71), good quality and studies which reported adjusted measure of effect (OR:1.30, 95%CI:1.10,1.50). Significant differences were found between ACEIs and ARBs with the latter being significantly associated with lower risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection (OR:0.24; 95%CI: 0.17,0.34). In conclusion, high-quality evidence exists for the effect of ACEIs/ARBs on some COVID-19 clinical outcomes.

unclear, and frequently changing management protocols, COVID-19 has significantly impacted the orthopaedic surgical practice during this pandemic crisis. Surgeons around the world needed closed introspection, contemplation, and prospective consensual recommendations for safe surgical practice and prevention of viral contamination. One hundred orthopaedic surgeons from 50 countries were sent a Google online form with a questionnaire explicating protocols for admission, surgeries, discharge, follow-up, relevant information affecting their surgical practices, difficulties faced, and many more important issues that happened during and after the lockdown. Ten surgeons critically construed and interpreted the data to form rationale guidelines and recommendations. Of the total, hand and microsurgery surgeons (52%), trauma surgeons (32%), joint replacement surgeons (20%), and arthroscopy surgeons (14%) actively participated in the survey. Surgeons from national public health care/government college hospitals (44%) and private/semiprivate practitioners (54%) were involved in the study. Countries had lockdown started as early as January 3, 2020 with the implementation of partial or complete lifting of lockdown in few countries while writing this article. Surgeons (58%) did not stop their surgical practice or clinics but preferred only emergency cases during the lockdown. Most of the surgeons (49%) had three-fourths reduction in their total patients turn-up and the remaining cases were managed by conservative (54%) methods. There was a 50 to 75% reduction in the number of surgeries. Surgeons did perform emergency procedures without COVID-19 tests but preferred reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR; 77%) and computed tomography (CT) scan chest (12%) tests for all elective surgical cases. Open fracture and emergency procedures (60%) and distal radius (55%) fractures were the most commonly performed surgeries. Surgeons preferred full personal protection equipment kits (69%) with a respirator (N95/FFP3), but in the case of unavailability, they used surgical masks and normal gowns. Regional/local anesthesia (70%) remained their choice for surgery to prevent the aerosolized risk of contaminations. Essential surgical follow-up with limited persons and visits was encouraged by 70% of the surgeons, whereas teleconsultation and telerehabilitation by 30% of the surgeons. Despite the protective equipment, one-third of the surgeons were afraid of getting infected and 56% feared of infecting their near and dear ones. Orthopaedic surgeons in private practice did face 50 to 75% financial loss and have to furlough 25% staff and 50% paramedical persons. Orthopaedics meetings were cancelled, and virtual meetings have become the preferred mode of sharing the knowledge and experiences avoiding human contacts. Staying at home, reading, and writing manuscripts became more interesting and an interesting lifestyle change is seen among the surgeons. Unanimously and without any doubt all accepted the fact that COVID-19 pandemic has reached an unprecedented level where personal hygiene, hand washing, social distancing, and safe surgical practices are the viable antidotes, and they have all slowly integrated these practices into their lives. Strict adherence to local authority recommendations and guidelines, uniform and standardized norms for admission, inpatient, and discharge, mandatory RT-PCR tests before surgery and in selective cases with CT scan chest, optimizing and regularizing the surgeries, avoiding and delaying nonemergency surgeries and follow-up protocols, use of teleconsultations cautiously, and working in close association with the World Health Organization and national health care systems will provide a conducive and safe working environment for orthopaedic surgeons and their fraternity and also will prevent the resurgence of COVID-19.", "doi": "10.1055/s-0040-1713964", "pmid": "33408440", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "JHAM2000002"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7773504"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-01-08T07:19:07.003Z", "modified": "2021-01-08T07:19:07.024Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "d50e4d3b23964fd892c53f371c4552f4", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/d50e4d3b23964fd892c53f371c4552f4.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/d50e4d3b23964fd892c53f371c4552f4"}}, "title": "Nordic welfare states\u2014still standing or changed by the COVID \u201019 crisis?", "authors": [{"family": "Greve", "given": "Bent", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Blomquist", "given": "Paula", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Hvinden", "given": "Bj\u00f8rn", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "van Gerven", "given": "Minna", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2020-12-00", "journal": {"title": "Soc Policy Adm", "issn": "0144-5596", "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": null, "issn-l": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1111/spol.12675", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Public Health": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-01-10T17:26:19.225Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:47:00.226Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "ca7515e94a4946148ea2fe65f49320d8", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/ca7515e94a4946148ea2fe65f49320d8.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/ca7515e94a4946148ea2fe65f49320d8"}}, "title": "Epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 cases and estimates of the reproductive numbers 1 month into the epidemic, Italy, 28 January to 31 March 2020.", "authors": [{"family": "Riccardo", "given": "Flavia", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Ajelli", "given": "Marco", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Andrianou", "given": "Xanthi D", "initials": "XD"}, {"family": "Bella", "given": "Antonino", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Del Manso", "given": "Martina", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Fabiani", "given": "Massimo", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Bellino", "given": "Stefania", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Boros", "given": "Stefano", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Urdiales", "given": "Alberto Mateo", "initials": "AM"}, {"family": "Marziano", "given": "Valentina", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Rota", "given": "Maria Cristina", "initials": "MC"}, {"family": "Filia", "given": "Antonietta", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "D'Ancona", "given": "Fortunato", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Siddu", "given": "Andrea", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Punzo", "given": "Ornella", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Trentini", "given": "Filippo", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Guzzetta", "given": "Giorgio", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Poletti", "given": "Piero", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Stefanelli", "given": "Paola", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Castrucci", "given": "Maria Rita", "initials": "MR"}, {"family": "Ciervo", "given": "Alessandra", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Di Benedetto", "given": "Corrado", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Tallon", "given": "Marco", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Piccioli", "given": "Andrea", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Brusaferro", "given": "Silvio", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Rezza", "given": "Giovanni", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Merler", "given": "Stefano", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Pezzotti", "given": "Patrizio", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "COVID-19 working group", "given": "", "initials": ""}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-12-00", "journal": {"title": "Euro Surveill", "issn": "1560-7917", "volume": "25", "issue": "49", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "BackgroundOn 20 February 2020, a locally acquired coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case was detected in Lombardy, Italy. This was the first signal of ongoing transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the country. The number of cases in Italy increased rapidly and the country became the first in Europe to experience a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.AimOur aim was to describe the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the first COVID-19 cases in Italy amid ongoing control measures.MethodsWe analysed all RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the national integrated surveillance system until 31 March 2020. We provide a descriptive epidemiological summary and estimate the basic and net reproductive numbers by region.ResultsOf the 98,716 cases of COVID-19 analysed, 9,512 were healthcare workers. Of the 10,943 reported COVID-19-associated deaths (crude case fatality ratio: 11.1%) 49.5% occurred in cases older than 80 years. Male sex and age were independent risk factors for COVID-19 death. Estimates of R 0 varied between 2.50 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.18-2.83) in Tuscany and 3.00 (95% CI: 2.68-3.33) in Lazio. The net reproduction number Rt in northern regions started decreasing immediately after the first detection.ConclusionThe COVID-19 outbreak in Italy showed a clustering onset similar to the one in Wuhan, China. R0 at 2.96 in Lombardy combined with delayed detection explains the high case load and rapid geographical spread. Overall, Rt in Italian regions showed early signs of decrease, with large diversity in incidence, supporting the importance of combined non-pharmacological control measures.", "doi": "10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.49.2000790", "pmid": "33303064", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Public Health": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-13T07:20:07.307Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:47:00.193Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "b5f72594dbb84c7d80156fb4fe5230aa", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/b5f72594dbb84c7d80156fb4fe5230aa.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/b5f72594dbb84c7d80156fb4fe5230aa"}}, "title": "Prospective role of thyroid disorders in monitoring COVID-19 pandemic", "authors": [{"family": "Kumari", "given": "Kanchan", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Chainy", "given": "Gagan B N", "initials": "GBN"}, {"family": "Subudhi", "given": "Umakanta", "initials": "U"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2020-12-00", "journal": {"title": "Heliyon", "issn": "2405-8440", "volume": "6", "issue": "12", "pages": "e05712", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05712", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-01-10T17:31:22.639Z", "modified": "2021-01-10T17:31:22.649Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "aa40739fe513445582a64d793c977c8c", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/aa40739fe513445582a64d793c977c8c.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/aa40739fe513445582a64d793c977c8c"}}, "title": "Creating and applying SIR modified compartmental model for calculation of COVID-19 lockdown efficiency.", "authors": [{"family": "Sharov", "given": "Konstantin S", "initials": "KS"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-12-00", "journal": {"title": "Chaos Solitons Fractals", "issn": "0960-0779", "volume": "141", "issue": null, "pages": "110295", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "We propose a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) modified model for Coronavirus disease - 2019 (COVID-19) spread to estimate the efficacy of lockdown measures introduced during the pandemic. As input data, we used COVID-19 epidemiological information collected in fifteen European countries either in private surveys or using official statistics. Thirteen countries implemented lockdown measures, two countries (Sweden, Iceland) not. As output parameters, we studied herd immunity level and time of formation. Comparison of these parameters was used as an indicator of effectiveness / ineffectiveness of lockdown measures. In the absence of a medical vaccine, herd immunity may be regarded as a factor of population adaptation to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2, the viral pathogen causing COVID-19 disease (SARS-CoV-2), and hence COVID-19 spreading stop. We demonstrated that there is no significant difference between lockdown and no-lockdown modes of COVID-19 containment, in terms of both herd immunity level and the time of achieving its maximum. The rationale for personal and business lockdowns may be found in the avoidance of healthcare system overburdening. However, lockdowns do not prevent any virus with droplet transmission (including SARS-CoV-2) from spreading. Therefore, in case of a future viral pathogen emergence, lockdown measures efficiency should not be overestimated, as it was done almost universally in the world during COVID-19 pandemic.", "doi": "10.1016/j.chaos.2020.110295", "pmid": "32994671", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0960-0779(20)30691-3"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7513696"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-03T09:02:25.737Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:46:13.423Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "a4de5d5c53974077a4b1cc5e40718bfd", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/a4de5d5c53974077a4b1cc5e40718bfd.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/a4de5d5c53974077a4b1cc5e40718bfd"}}, "title": "Guidance regarding COVID-19 for survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancer: A statement from the International Late Effects of Childhood Cancer Guideline Harmonization Group.", "authors": [{"family": "Verbruggen", "given": "Lisanne C", "initials": "LC"}, {"family": "Wang", "given": "Yuehan", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Armenian", "given": "Saro H", "initials": "SH"}, {"family": "Ehrhardt", "given": "Matthew J", "initials": "MJ"}, {"family": "van der Pal", "given": "Helena J H", "initials": "HJH"}, {"family": "van Dalen", "given": "Elvira C", "initials": "EC"}, {"family": "van As", "given": "Jorrit W", "initials": "JW"}, {"family": "Bardi", "given": "Edit", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Baust", "given": "Katja", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Berger", "given": "Claire", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Castagnola", "given": "Elio", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Devine", "given": "Katie A", "initials": "KA"}, {"family": "Gebauer", "given": "Judith", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Marchak", "given": "Jordan Gilleland", "initials": "JG"}, {"family": "Glaser", "given": "Adam W", "initials": "AW"}, {"family": "Groll", "given": "Andreas H", "initials": "AH"}, {"family": "Haeusler", "given": "Gabrielle M", "initials": "GM"}, {"family": "den Hartogh", "given": "Jaap", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Haupt", "given": "Riccardo", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Hjorth", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Kato", "given": "Miho", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Kep\u00e1k", "given": "Tom\u00e1\u0161", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Koopman", "given": "Maria M W Rianne", "initials": "MMWR"}, {"family": "Langer", "given": "Thorsten", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Maeda", "given": "Miho", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Michel", "given": "Gisela", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Muraca", "given": "Monica", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Nathan", "given": "Paul C", "initials": "PC"}, {"family": "van den Oever", "given": "Selina R", "initials": "SR"}, {"family": "Pavasovic", "given": "Vesna", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Sato", "given": "Satomi", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Schulte", "given": "Fiona", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Sung", "given": "Lillian", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Tissing", "given": "Wim", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Uyttebroeck", "given": "Anne", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Mulder", "given": "Ren\u00e9e L", "initials": "RL"}, {"family": "Kuehni", "given": "Claudia", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Skinner", "given": "Roderick", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Hudson", "given": "Melissa M", "initials": "MM"}, {"family": "Kremer", "given": "Leontien C M", "initials": "LCM"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-12-00", "journal": {"title": "Pediatr Blood Cancer", "issn": "1545-5017", "volume": "67", "issue": "12", "pages": "e28702", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Childhood, adolescent, and young adult (CAYA) cancer survivors may be at risk for a severe course of COVID-19.

In this study, MR1-restricted T (MR1T) cells were detected through the use of MR1 tetramers in circulation and tissues of Pteropus alecto (Pa) bats. Pa MR1T cells exhibited weak responses to MR1-presented microbial metabolites at resting state. However, following priming with MR1-presented agonist they proliferated, upregulated critical transcription factors and cytolytic proteins, and gained transient expression of Th1/17-related cytokines and antibacterial cytotoxicity.

To remedy this, an anti-inflammatory drug should have an appropriate pharmacokinetic half-life or better still, a sustained anti-inflammatory drug response. However, we still lack a quantitative mechanistic understanding of such sustained effects. Here, we study the anti-inflammatory response to a common glucocorticoid drug, dexamethasone. We find a sustained response 22 hours after drug removal. With hypothesis testing using mathematical modeling, we unravel the underlying mechanism-a slow release of dexamethasone from the receptor-drug complex.

Challenges reported included staff constraints (30% drop), reduction in planned monitoring activity (67% drop of site initiation visits and 64% of monitoring visits) and patient recruitment (61% drop compared with that in 2019). The percentage of phase I, phase II trials and molecular platforms closing to recruitment in at least one site was 48.5%, 61.3% and 64.3%, respectively. In addition, 26% of sites had restrictions on performing trial assessments because of local contingency plans. Almost half of the units suffered impact upon pending contracts. Most hospitals (65%) are planning on improving organisational and structural changes.\r\n\r\nThe study reveals a profound disruption of paediatric cancer early-phase clinical research due to the COVID-19 pandemic across Europe.

transdisciplinary partnership that combines a diverse range of perspectives necessary for understanding the increasingly complex societal role played by modern health care and medical research. The term \"precision health\" is being increasingly used to express the need for greater awareness of environmental and genomic characteristics that may lead to divergent health outcomes between different groups within a population. Enhancing awareness of diversity has parallels with calls for \"health democracy\" and greater patient-public participation within health care and medical research. Approaching health care in this way goes beyond a narrow focus on the societal determinants of health, since it requires considering health as a deliberative space, which occurs often at the banal or everyday level. As an initial empirical focus, PHED is directed toward the health needs of marginalized migrants (including refugees and asylum seekers, as well as migrants with temporary residency, often involving a legally or economically precarious situation) as vulnerable groups that are often overlooked by health care. Developing new transdisciplinary knowledge on these groups provides the potential to enhance their wellbeing and benefit the wider society through challenging the exclusions of these groups that create pockets of extreme ill-health, which, as we see with COVID-19, should be better understood as \"acts of self-harm\" for the wider negative impact on humanity.\n\nWe aim to establish and identify precision health strategies, as well as promote equal access to quality health care, drawing upon knowledge gained from studying the health care of marginalized migrants.\n\nThe project is based in Sweden at Malm\u00f6 and Lund Universities. At the outset, the network activities do not require ethical approval where they will not involve data collection, since the purpose of PHED is to strengthen international research contacts, establish new research within precision strategies, and construct educational research activities for junior colleagues within academia. However, whenever new research is funded and started, ethical approval for that specific data collection will be sought.\n\nThe PHED project has been funded from January 1, 2019. Results of the transdisciplinary collaboration will be disseminated via a series of international conferences, workshops, and web-based materials. To ensure the network project advances toward applied research, a major goal of dissemination is to produce tools for applied research, including information to enhance health accessibility for vulnerable communities, such as marginalized migrant populations in Sweden.\n\nThere is a need to identify tools to enable the prevention and treatment of a wide spectrum of health-related outcomes and their link to social as well as environmental issues. There is also a need to identify and investigate barriers to precision health based on democratic principles.\n\nDERR1-10.2196/17324.", "doi": "10.2196/17324", "pmid": "33252352", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "v9i11e17324"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-03T08:24:10.169Z", "modified": "2020-12-03T08:24:10.192Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "9159f26c8905426ba3599eaf2c635be2", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/9159f26c8905426ba3599eaf2c635be2.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/9159f26c8905426ba3599eaf2c635be2"}}, "title": "The COVID-19 pandemic: consequences for nephrology.", "authors": [{"family": "Bruchfeld", "given": "Annette", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-11-30", "journal": {"title": "Nat Rev Nephrol", "issn": "1759-507X", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1038/s41581-020-00381-4", "pmid": "33257872", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1038/s41581-020-00381-4"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-03T08:18:19.455Z", "modified": "2020-12-03T08:18:19.476Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "7aeabc3750d1481bb578d56cb544837a", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7aeabc3750d1481bb578d56cb544837a.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7aeabc3750d1481bb578d56cb544837a"}}, "title": "Rapid review of suspected adverse drug events due to remdesivir in the WHO database; findings and implications.", "authors": [{"family": "Charan", "given": "Jaykaran", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Kaur", "given": "Rimple Jeet", "initials": "RJ"}, {"family": "Bhardwaj", "given": "Pankaj", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Haque", "given": "Mainul", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Sharma", "given": "Praveen", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Misra", "given": "Sanjeev", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Godman", "given": "Brian", "initials": "B"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-11-30", "journal": {"title": "Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol", "issn": "1751-2441", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Objectives: Remdesivir has shown promise in the management of patients with COVID-19 although recent studies have shown concerns with its effectiveness in practice.

Methods: Interrogation of WHO VigiBase\u00ae from 2015 to 2020 coupled with published studies of ADEs in COVID-19 patients. The main outcome measures are the extent of ADEs broken down by factors including age, seriousness, region and organ. Results: A total 1086 ADEs were reported from the 439 individual case reports up to 19 July 2020 in the VigiBase\u00ae, reduced to 1004 once duplicates were excluded. Almost all ADEs concerned COVID-19 patients (92.5%), with an appreciable number from the Americas (67.7%). The majority of ADEs were from males > 45 years and were serious (82.5%). An increase in hepatic enzymes (32.1%), renal injury (14.4%), rise in creatinine levels (11.2%) respiratory failure (6.4%) were the most frequently reported ADEs. Conclusions: Deterioration of liver and kidney function are frequently observed ADEs with remdesivir; consequently, patients should be monitored for these ADEs.

A severe disease course is more likely in older patients and patients with pre-existing respiratory and cardiovascular conditions (2).

However, these measures may also lead to increases in social isolation, loneliness, and stress, which can alter the consumption of pornography habits. The aim of the study was thus to explore the interest pattern in pornography and coronavirus-themed pornography during the COVID-19 outbreak. Google Trends\u00ae was employed to determine the most popular porn websites (Porn, XNXX, PornHub, xVideos, and xHamster), and coronavirus-themed pornography worldwide and in six nations with different COVID-19 outbreak and self-isolation recommendations. We analyzed every search trend on Google\u00ae from January 9, 2020 to May 25, 2020 using \"joint point regression analysis\". Comparisons of week relative search volume (WRSV) and temporal patterns were analyzed to assess the change of interest in search terms during nations lockdowns. Paired t-test was used to compare WRSV values among the porn websites during the national lockdowns and the equivalent timespan of the weeks in the previous 4 years. The research trend of almost every keyword increased with significant inflection points for those nations with a straight \"stay at home orders\" (China, Italy, Spain, and France). \"PornHub\" and \"Porn\" showed the highest increase of interest worldwide with an average weekend percentage change (AWPC) of 4.9 and 3.8, respectively. The mean WRSV for keywords in USA and Sweden did not show a similar increase as the other nations. The WRSV percentage change with the historical data had a peak during the straight nations' lockdowns (p < 0.01).

The consequences for global mental health due to COVID-19 are likely to be significant and may have a long-term impact on the global burden of disease. Besides physical vulnerability, pregnant women are at increased risk of mental health problems such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder due to the consequences of social distancing. It can result in altered healthcare routines, less support from the family and friends, and in some cases, partners not being allowed to be present during prenatal visits, labour and delivery. Higher than expected, rates of perinatal anxiety and depression have been already reported during the pandemic. Pregnant women may also feel insecure and worried about the effects of COVID-19 on their unborn child if they get infected during pregnancy. Today, young urban women are used to using internet services frequently and efficiently. Therefore, providing mental health support to pregnant women via internet may be effective in ameliorating their anxiety/depression, reducing the risk of serious mental health disorders, and lead to improved maternal and perinatal outcomes.\r\n\r\nOur aim is to explore the effectiveness of a web-based psychosocial peer-to-peer support intervention in reducing the risk and severity of perinatal mental health disorders and preventing adverse pregnancy outcomes among pregnant women living in metropolitan urban settings.\r\n\r\nWe plan to conduct a multicentre prospective randomised controlled trial, Mental health of Urban Mothers trial. Pregnant women living in large metropolitan cities will be recruited using internet-based application through non-profit organisations' websites. The women who consent will be randomised to receive a web-based peer-to-peer support intervention or usual care. Data will be analysed to identify the effects of intervention on Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Score and Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7 scores as well as pregnancy outcomes. The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on maternal stress will be assesed using Impact Event Scale-R. Any differences in outcomes between cities will be addressed in subgroup analyses.\r\n\r\nThe study will be conducted according to the principles of Good Clinical Practice and will follow the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Disruptions to training and competition schedules can induce athletes' emotional distress, while concomitant government-imposed restrictions (e.g., social isolation, quarantines) reduce the availability of athletes' social and emotional support. Written Emotional Disclosure (WED) has been used extensively in a variety of settings with diverse populations as a means to promote emotional processing. The expressive writing protocol has been used to a limited extent in the context of sport and predominantly in support of athletes' emotional processing during injury rehabilitation. We propose that WED offers an evidence-based treatment that can promote athletes' mental health and support their return to competition. Research exploring the efficacy of the expressive writing protocol highlights a number of theoretical models underpinning the positive effects of WED; we outline how each of these potential mechanisms can address the multidimensional complexity of the challenging circumstances arising from the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., loss of earnings, returning to training and competition).

Critically, the unique role of COVID-19-related anxiety on WM could not be explained by demographic factors, or other psychological factors such as state and trait anxiety or fluid intelligence. Moreover, across three assessment points spanning 5-6 weeks, COVID-19-related anxiety levels tended to decrease over time.

Beyond slowing viral transmission, strict lockdowns have severe economic consequences. This work investigated response stringency, quantified by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker's Stringency Index, and examined how restrictive interventions affected infection rates and gross domestic product (GDP) in China and OECD countries. Accounting for response timing, China imposed the most stringent restrictions, while Sweden and Japan were the least stringent. Expected GDP declines range from -8% (Japan) to -15.4% (UK). While greater restrictions generally slowed viral transmission, they failed to reach statistical significance and reduced GDP ( p = 0.006). Timing was fundamental: governments who responded to the pandemic faster saw greater reductions in viral transmission (p = 0.013), but worse decreases in GDP (p = 0.044). Thus, response stringency has a greater effect on GDP than infection rates, which are instead affected by the timing of COVID-19 interventions. Attempts to mitigate economic impacts by delaying restrictions or decreasing stringency may buoy GDP in the short term but increase infection rates, the longer-term economic consequences of which are not yet fully understood. As highly restrictive interventions were successful in some but not all countries, decision-makers must consider whether their strategies are appropriate for the country on health and economic grounds.", "doi": "10.3390/ijerph17238725", "pmid": "33255383", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "ijerph17238725"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-03T08:18:31.993Z", "modified": "2020-12-03T08:18:32.007Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "8d08457dded94192bbd8f026ed52f527", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/8d08457dded94192bbd8f026ed52f527.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/8d08457dded94192bbd8f026ed52f527"}}, "title": "At the Epicenter of COVID-19-the Tragic Failure of the Global Supply Chain for Medical Supplies.", "authors": [{"family": "Bhaskar", "given": "Sonu", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Tan", "given": "Jeremy", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Bogers", "given": "Marcel L A M", "initials": "MLAM"}, {"family": "Minssen", "given": "Timo", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Badaruddin", "given": "Hishamuddin", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Israeli-Korn", "given": "Simon", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Chesbrough", "given": "Henry", "initials": "H"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-11-24", "journal": {"title": "Front Public Health", "issn": "2296-2565", "volume": "8", "issue": null, "pages": "562882", "issn-l": "2296-2565"}, "abstract": "The tragic failure of the global supply chain in the face of the current coronavirus outbreak has caused acute shortages of essential frontline medical devices and personal protective equipment, crushing fear among frontline health workers and causing fundamental concerns about the sustainability of the health system.

Abbott's SARS-COV-2 IgG immunoassay was used with a signal cut-off ratio of \u22651.4. Every third week from the beginning of May, blood samples were drawn, and the participants completed a questionnaire regarding symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and the result of any SARS-CoV-2 PCR performed since the last sampling occasion. Participants with IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were re-sampled only on the sixth and last occasion. Results: At the start of the study, 18 (15%) participants had SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. At the end, 25 (19%) of 131 participants were seropositive. One case of asymptomatic infection was detected, and two cases with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 did not develop IgG antibodies.

Few studies have examined these emerging disparities using indicators of SDOH. Objective: To evaluate predictors of COVID-19 test positivity, morbidity, and mortality and their implications for inequalities in SDOH and for future policies and health care improvements. Design, Setting, and Participants: A cross sectional analysis was performed on all patients tested for COVID-19 on the basis of symptoms with either a history of travel to at risk regions or close contact with a confirmed case, across the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) up until April 26th 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was death from COVID-19 and secondary outcomes were test positivity, and morbidity (e.g., hospitalization and intubation caused by COVID-19). Results: Of 20,899 tested patients, 8,928 tested positive, 1,701 were hospitalized, 684 were intubated, and 1,179 died from COVID-19. Age, sex, race/ethnicity, New York City borough (derived from first 3 digits of zip-code), and English as preferred language were significant predictors of test positivity, hospitalization, intubation and COVID-19 mortality following multivariable logistic regression analyses. Conclusions and Relevance: People residing in poorer boroughs were more likely to be burdened by and die from COVID-19.

The three-dimensional microstructure of the material, a fuel cell gas diffusion layer, is acquired via X-ray computed tomography and used as input for lattice Boltzmann simulations. We perform a quantitative analysis of the multiphase pore-scale dynamics, and we identify the dominant fluid structures governing mass transport. The results show the existence of three different regimes of transport: a fast inertial dynamics at short times, characterised by a compact uniform front, a viscous-capillary regime at intermediate times, where liquid is transported along a gradually increasing number of preferential flow paths of the size of one-two pores, and a third regime at longer times, where liquid, after having reached the outlet, is exclusively flowing along such flow paths and the two-phase fluid structures are stabilised. We observe that the fibrous layer presents significant variations in its microscopic morphology, which have an important effect on the pore invasion dynamics, and counteract the stabilising viscous force. Liquid transport is indeed affected by the presence of microstructure-induced capillary pressures acting adversely to the flow, leading to capillary fingering transport mechanism and unstable front displacement, even in the absence of hydrophobic treatments of the porous material. We propose a macroscopic model based on an effective contact angle that mimics the effects of the such a dynamic capillary pressure.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the association between initial dosing strategy of thromboprophylaxis in critically ill COVID-19 patients and the risk of death, thromboembolism, and bleeding.\r\n\r\nIn this retrospective study, all critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to two intensive care units in March and April 2020 were eligible. Patients were categorized into three groups according to initial daily dose of thromboprophylaxis: low (2500-4500 IU tinzaparin or 2500-5000 IU dalteparin), medium (> 4500 IU but < 175 IU/kilogram, kg, of body weight tinzaparin or > 5000 IU but < 200 IU/kg of body weight dalteparin), and high dose (\u2265 175 IU/kg of body weight tinzaparin or \u2265 200 IU/kg of body weight dalteparin). Thromboprophylaxis dosage was based on local standardized recommendations, not on degree of critical illness or risk of thrombosis. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals of death within 28 days from ICU admission. Multivariable models were adjusted for sex, age, body mass index, Simplified Acute Physiology Score III, invasive respiratory support, and initial dosing strategy of thromboprophylaxis.\r\n\r\nA total of 152 patients were included: 67 received low-, 48 medium-, and 37 high-dose thromboprophylaxis. Baseline characteristics did not differ between groups. For patients who received high-dose prophylaxis, mortality was lower (13.5%) compared to those who received medium dose (25.0%) or low dose (38.8%), p = 0.02. The hazard ratio of death was 0.33 (95% confidence intervals 0.13-0.87) among those who received high dose, and 0.88 (95% confidence intervals 0.43-1.83) among those who received medium dose, as compared to those who received low-dose thromboprophylaxis. There were fewer thromboembolic events in the high (2.7%) vs medium (18.8%) and low-dose thromboprophylaxis (17.9%) groups, p = 0.04.\r\n\r\nAmong critically ill COVID-19 patients with respiratory

We investigated the association between use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) and Covid-19 hospitalization/death in a large nationwide population.\r\n\r\nPatients with hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, kidney disease, or ischemic heart disease registered in the Swedish National Patient Registry until February 1 st 2020 were included and followed until May 31st 2020. Covid-19 cases were defined based on hospitalization/death for Covid-19. Multivariable logistic and Cox regressions were fitted to investigate the association between ACEi/ARB and MRA and risk of hospitalization/death for Covid-19 in the overall population, and of all-cause mortality in Covid-19 cases. We performed consistency analysis to quantify the impact of potential unmeasured confounding. Of 1,387,746 patients (60% receiving ACEi/ARB and 5.8% MRA) 7,146 (0.51%) had incident hospitalization/death from Covid-19. After adjustment for 45 variables, ACEi/ARB use was associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization/death for Covid-19 (Odds Ratio [95% Confidence Interval]: 0.86[0.81-0.91]) in the overall population, and with reduced mortality in Covid-19 cases (Hazard Ratio: 0.89[0.82-0.96]).

The State of S\u00e3o Paulo failed to adopt an effective social distancing strategy, reaching at most 59% in late March and started to relax the measures in late June, dropping to 41% in 08 August. Therefore, S\u00e3o Paulo relies heavily on a massive testing strategy in the attempt to control the epidemic. Two alternative strategies combined with economic evaluations were simulated. One strategy included indiscriminately testing the entire population of the State, reaching more than 40 million people at a maximum cost of 2.25 billion USD, that would reduce the total number of cases by the end of 2020 by 90%. The second strategy investigated testing only symptomatic cases and their immediate contacts - this strategy reached a maximum cost of 150 million USD but also reduced the number of cases by 90%. The conclusion is that if the State of S\u00e3o Paulo had decided to adopt the simulated strategy on April the 1st, it would have been possible to reduce the total number of cases by 90% at a cost of 2.25 billion US dollars for the indiscriminate strategy but at a much smaller cost of 125 million US dollars for the selective testing of symptomatic cases and their contacts.", "doi": "10.1016/j.idm.2020.11.004", "pmid": "33235942", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S2468-0427(20)30074-9"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7677040"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-27T10:28:12.415Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:46:13.055Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "20fd08edee8f451198a5e24ea3f85ab0", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/20fd08edee8f451198a5e24ea3f85ab0.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/20fd08edee8f451198a5e24ea3f85ab0"}}, "title": "Economic arguments in migrant health policymaking: proposing a research agenda.", "authors": [{"family": "Gottlieb", "given": "Nora", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Trummer", "given": "Ursula", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Davidovitch", "given": "Nadav", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Krasnik", "given": "Allan", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Ju\u00e1rez", "given": "Sol P", "initials": "SP"}, {"family": "Rostila", "given": "Mikael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Biddle", "given": "Louise", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Bozorgmehr", "given": "Kayvan", "initials": "K"}], "type": "letter", "published": "2020-11-20", "journal": {"title": "Global Health", "issn": "1744-8603", "volume": "16", "issue": "1", "pages": "113", "issn-l": "1744-8603"}, "abstract": "Welfare states around the world restrict access to public healthcare for some migrant groups. Formal restrictions on migrants' healthcare access are often justified with economic arguments; for example, as a means to prevent excess costs and safeguard scarce resources. However, existing studies on the economics of migrant health policies suggest that restrictive policies increase rather than decrease costs. This evidence has largely been ignored in migration debates. Amplifying the relationship between welfare state transformations and the production of inequalities, the Covid-19 pandemic may fuel exclusionary rhetoric and politics; or it may serve as an impetus to reconsider the costs that one group's exclusion from health can entail for all members of society.The public health community has a responsibility to promote evidence-informed health policies that are ethically and economically sound, and to counter anti-migrant and racial discrimination (whether overt or masked with economic reasoning). Toward this end, we propose a research agenda which includes 1) the generation of a comprehensive body of evidence on economic aspects of migrant health policies, 2) the clarification of the role of economic arguments in migration debates, 3) (self-)critical reflection on the ethics and politics of the production of economic evidence, 4) the introduction of evidence into migrant health policymaking processes, and 5) the endorsement of inter- and transdisciplinary approaches.

Importantly, the severity of COVID-19 depends on the interactions between the viral infection, ageing and chronic diseases such as metabolic, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and obesity which are themselves influenced by environmental stressors. The mechanisms of these interactions deserve additional scrutiny. Both the pandemic and the social response to the disease have elicited an array of behavioural and societal changes that may remain long after the pandemic and that may have long term health effects including on mental health. Recovery plans are currently being discussed or implemented and the environmental and health impacts of those plans are not clearly foreseen. Clearly, COVID-19 will have a long-lasting impact on the environmental health field and will open new research perspectives and policy needs.", "doi": "10.1016/j.envint.2020.106272", "pmid": "33238229", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0160-4120(20)32227-3"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7674147"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-27T10:27:55.912Z", "modified": "2020-11-30T07:44:55.359Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "427a5f1f5bfb4a65a0ee29d88d1e1242", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/427a5f1f5bfb4a65a0ee29d88d1e1242.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/427a5f1f5bfb4a65a0ee29d88d1e1242"}}, "title": "Synthesis of Recommendations From 25 Countries and 31 Oncology Societies: How to Navigate Through Covid-19 Labyrinth.", "authors": [{"family": "Kamposioras", "given": "Konstantinos", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Mauri", "given": "Davide", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Papadimitriou", "given": "Konstantinos", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Anthoney", "given": "Alan", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Hindi", "given": "Nadia", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Petricevic", "given": "Branka", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Dambrosio", "given": "Mario", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Valachis", "given": "Antonis", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Kountourakis", "given": "Pantelis", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Kopecky", "given": "Jindrich", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Kuhar", "given": "Cvetka Gra\u0161i\u010d", "initials": "CG"}, {"family": "Popovic", "given": "Lazar", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Chilingirova", "given": "Nataliya P", "initials": "NP"}, {"family": "Zarkavelis", "given": "George", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "de Mello", "given": "Ramon Andrade", "initials": "RA"}, {"family": "Plaveti\u0107", "given": "Natalija Dedi\u0107", "initials": "ND"}, {"family": "Christopoulos", "given": "Christos", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Mostert", "given": "Bianca", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Goffin", "given": "John R", "initials": "JR"}, {"family": "Tzachanis", "given": "Dimitiros", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Saraireh", "given": "Haytham Hamed", "initials": "HH"}, {"family": "Ma", "given": "Fei", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Pavese", "given": "Ida", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Tolia", "given": "Maria", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-11-19", "journal": {"title": "Front Oncol", "issn": "2234-943X", "volume": "10", "issue": null, "pages": "575148", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Pandemic COVID-19 is an unexpected challenge for the oncological community, indicating potential detrimental effects on cancer patients.

Understanding how the risk increases when NPIs are lifted is important for decision making. Treating NPIs equally across countries and regions limits the possibility for modelling differences in epidemic response, as the response to the NPIs influences can vary between regions and this can affect the epidemic outcome, so do the strength and speed of lifting these.

However, we know from extensive studies of social networks that there is significant variation in the number of connections and thus social contacts each individual has. Individuals with more social contacts are more likely to attract and spread infection. These individuals are likely the drivers of the epidemic, so-called superspreaders. When many superspreaders are immune, it becomes more difficult for the disease to spread, as the connectedness of the social network dramatically decreases. If one assumes all individuals being equally connected and thus as likely to spread disease as in a SIR model, this is not true.\r\n\r\nMethods To account for the impact of social network structure on epidemic development, we model the dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 on a dynamic preferential attachment graph which changes appearance proportional to observed mobility changes. We sample a serial interval distribution that determines the probability of dispersion for all infected nodes each day. We model the dispersion in different age groups using age-specific infection fatality rates. We vary the infection probabilities in different age groups and analyse the outcome.\r\n\r\nResults The impact of movement on network dynamics plays a crucial role in the spread of infections. We find that higher movement results in higher spread due to an increased probability of new connections being made within a social network. We show that saturation in the dispersion can be reached much earlier on a preferential attachment graph compared to spread on a random graph, which is more similar to estimations using R0.\r\n\r\nConclusions We provide a novel method for modelling epidemics by using a dynamic network structure related to observed mobility changes.

Rapid point-of-care (POC) tests have been doubted due to an eventual risk of production errors, although it is unstudied whether such error would affect test sensitivity and/or specificity. We aimed to evaluate two separate production lots of a commercially available test intended for rapid detection of IgM and IgG against the N-terminal part of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S1). Materials and methods: Serum samples from individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, by RT-PCR and/or serology, and pre-COVID-19 negative control sera gathered from a biobank during 2018 were collected. The presence of anti-S1 IgM/IgG was verified by an in-house Luminex-based serological assay, serving as reference method. The index test was a commercially available rapid POC-test (the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette [Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech Co Ltd, Huzhou, Zhejiang, China/Healgen Scientific, LLC, U.S.A.]). Results: One hundred samples were verified positive for anti-S1 IgG (median fluorescence intensity (MFI) greater than or equal to 900) and 74 for anti-S1 IgM (MFI greater than or equal to 700), confirmed by RT-PCR (n=90) and/or serology (n=89). None of the negative controls (n=200; MFI <300) had SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 IgM, while one tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 IgG. For the two lots, the sensitivities of the rapid test were 93.2% (69/74; 95% CI: 85.1% - 97.1%) and 87.8% (65/74; 95% CI: 78.5% - 93.5%) for IgM, respectively 93.0% (93/100; 95% CI: 86.3% - 96.6%) and 100.0% for IgG (100/100; 95% CI: 96.3% - 100.0%). The specificity for both lots was 100% for IgM (200/200; 95% CI: 98.1% - 100%) and 99.5% for IgG (199/200; 95% CI: 97.2% - 99.9%). The positive predictive value was 100% for IgM and 98.9% and 99.0% for IgG. The negative predictive value was 95.7% and 97.6% for IgM, and 96.6% and 100.0% for IgG. Conclusion: The rapid POC-test used in this study is suitable to assess SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 specific IgM/IgG, as a measure of previous virus exposure on an individual level. While the specificity was not affected by production lot, external validation of separate lots of rapid POC-tests is encouraged to ensure high sensitivity before market introduction.", "doi": "10.1101/2020.08.27.20182923", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Funder: VR": null, "Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Biochemistry": null, "Category: Genomics & transcriptomics": null, "Category: Health": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-11T14:10:18.614Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:45:47.803Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "b4ad408a15f543c599c0cb75863ae60d", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/b4ad408a15f543c599c0cb75863ae60d.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/b4ad408a15f543c599c0cb75863ae60d"}}, "title": "Mitigating COVID-19 Impact on the Portuguese Population Mental Health: The Opportunity That Lies in Digital Mental Health.", "authors": [{"family": "Mendes-Santos", "given": "Cristina", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "Gerhard", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Weiderpass", "given": "Elisabete", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Santana", "given": "Rui", "initials": "R"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-11-16", "journal": {"title": "Front Public Health", "issn": "2296-2565", "volume": "8", "issue": null, "pages": "553345", "issn-l": "2296-2565"}, "abstract": "COVID-19 mitigation measures present unprecedented challenges in mental healthcare delivery, posing high risk to the mental health of at-risk populations, namely patients diagnosed with COVID-19, frontline healthcare providers, and those submitted to quarantine or isolation measures, as well as the general population.

Serological tests will improve our understanding of the infection and immunity in this population, unless the tests give false positive results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the specificity of SARS-Cov-2 serological assays with samples from patients with chronic inflammatory diseases collected before April 2019, thus defined as negative.\r\n\r\nMethods Samples from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS, n=10), rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n=47) with or without rheumatoid factor (RF) and/or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP2) and RF +/- systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, n=10), were tested with 17 commercially available lateral flow assays (LFA), two ELISA kits and one in-house developed multiplex bead-based assay.\r\n\r\nResults Six LFA and the in-house IgG assay gave the correct negative results for all samples. However, the majority of assays (n=13), gave false positive signal with samples from patients with RA and SLE. This was most notable in RF positive RA samples. MS samples did not give any false positive in any of the assays.\r\n\r\nConclusion The majority of the verified serological assays were sensitive to interfering antibodies in samples from patients with chronic inflammatory diseases and therefore may have poor specificity in this context.

been shown to improve symptoms and quality of life in patients with chronic heart failure and iron deficiency. We aimed to evaluate the effect of ferric carboxymaltose, compared with placebo, on outcomes in patients who were stabilised after an episode of acute heart failure.\n\nAFFIRM-AHF was a multicentre, double-blind, randomised trial done at 121 sites in Europe, South America, and Singapore. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, were hospitalised for acute heart failure with concomitant iron deficiency (defined as ferritin <100 \u03bcg/L, or 100-299 \u03bcg/L with transferrin saturation <20%), and had a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 50%. Before hospital discharge, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous ferric carboxymaltose or placebo for up to 24 weeks, dosed according to the extent of iron deficiency. To maintain masking of patients and study personnel, treatments were administered in black syringes by personnel not involved in any study assessments. The primary outcome was a composite of total hospitalisations for heart failure and cardiovascular death up to 52 weeks after randomisation, analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment and had at least one post-randomisation data point. Secondary outcomes were the composite of total cardiovascular hospitalisations and cardiovascular death; cardiovascular death; total heart failure hospitalisations; time to first heart failure hospitalisation or cardiovascular death; and days lost due to heart failure hospitalisations or cardiovascular death, all evaluated up to 52 weeks after randomisation. Safety was assessed in all patients for whom study treatment was started. A pre-COVID-19 sensitivity analysis on the primary and secondary outcomes was prespecified. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02937454, and has now been completed.\n\nBetween March 21, 2017, and July 30, 2019, 1525 patients were screened, of whom 1132 patients were randomly assigned to study groups. Study treatment was started in 1110 patients, and 1108 (558 in the carboxymaltose group and 550 in the placebo group) had at least one post-randomisation value. 293 primary events (57\u00b72 per 100 patient-years) occurred in the ferric carboxymaltose group and 372 (72\u00b75 per 100 patient-years) occurred in the placebo group (rate ratio [RR] 0\u00b779, 95% CI 0\u00b762-1\u00b701, p=0\u00b7059). 370 total cardiovascular hospitalisations and cardiovascular deaths occurred in the ferric carboxymaltose group and 451 occurred in the placebo group (RR 0\u00b780, 95% CI 0\u00b764-1\u00b700, p=0\u00b7050). There was no difference in cardiovascular death between the two groups (77 [14%] of 558 in the ferric carboxymaltose group vs 78 [14%] in the placebo group; hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b796, 95% CI 0\u00b770-1\u00b732, p=0\u00b781). 217 total heart failure hospitalisations occurred in the ferric carboxymaltose group and 294 occurred in the placebo group (RR 0\u00b774; 95% CI 0\u00b758-0\u00b794, p=0\u00b7013). The composite of first heart failure hospitalisation or cardiovascular death occurred in 181 (32%) patients in the ferric carboxymaltose group and 209 (38%) in the placebo group (HR 0\u00b780, 95% CI 0\u00b766-0\u00b798, p=0\u00b7030). Fewer days were lost due to heart failure hospitalisations and cardiovascular death for patients assigned to ferric carboxymaltose compared with placebo (369 days per 100 patient-years vs 548 days per 100 patient-years; RR 0\u00b767, 95% CI 0\u00b747-0\u00b797, p=0\u00b7035). Serious adverse events occurred in 250 (45%) of 559 patients in the ferric carboxymaltose group and 282 (51%) of 551 patients in the placebo group.\n\nIn patients with iron deficiency, a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 50%, and who were stabilised after an episode of acute heart failure, treatment with ferric carboxymaltose was safe and reduced the risk of heart failure hospitalisations, with no apparent effect on the risk of cardiovascular death.\n\nVifor Pharma.", "doi": "10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32339-4", "pmid": "33197395", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "ClinicalTrials.gov", "key": "NCT02937454"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-27T10:49:53.803Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:45:47.859Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "040cdb5e913f4417ba0f2d8f35bfc266", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/040cdb5e913f4417ba0f2d8f35bfc266.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/040cdb5e913f4417ba0f2d8f35bfc266"}}, "title": "Human soluble ACE2 improves the effect of remdesivir in SARS-CoV-2 infection.", "authors": [{"family": "Monteil", "given": "Vanessa", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Dyczynski", "given": "Matheus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Lauschke", "given": "Volker M", "initials": "VM"}, {"family": "Kwon", "given": "Hyesoo", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Wirnsberger", "given": "Gerald", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Youhanna", "given": "Sonia", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Zhang", "given": "Haibo", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "S Slutsky", "given": "Arthur", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Hurtado Del Pozo", "given": "Carmen", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Horn", "given": "Moritz", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Montserrat", "given": "Nuria", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Penninger", "given": "Josef M", "initials": "JM"}, {"family": "Mirazimi", "given": "Ali", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-11-12", "journal": {"title": "EMBO Mol Med", "issn": "1757-4684", "issn-l": "1757-4676", "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": "e13426"}, "abstract": "There is a critical need for safe and effective drugs for COVID-19.

Swab samples were taken from individual ceiling ventilation openings and surfaces in central ducts. Samples were subsequently subjected to rRT-PCR targeting the N and E genes of SARS-CoV-2.

Based on the structural similarities of viral and host proteins, we initially generated a protein-protein interactome profile. Further computational analysis combined with Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and KEGG pathway analysis predicted key annotated pathways associated with viral pathogenesis. These include MAPK signaling, complement, and coagulation cascades, endocytosis, PD-L1 expression, PD-1 checkpoint pathway in cancer and C-type lectin receptor signaling pathways. Degree centrality analysis pinned down to MAPK1, MAPK3, AKT1, and SRC are crucial drivers of signaling pathways and often overlap with the associated pathways. Most strikingly, the complement and coagulation cascade and platelet activation pathways are interconnected, presumably directing thrombotic activity observed in severe or critical cases of COVID-19. This is complemented by in vitro studies of Huh7 cell infection and analysis of the transcriptome and proteomic profile of gene candidates during viral infection. The most known candidates associated with complement and coagulation cascade signaling by KEGG pathway analysis showed significant up-regulated fold change during viral infection.

Local differences in viral spread was shown by analyzing weekly composite samples of wastewater from five sampling sites for four weeks. The highest amount of virus was found from the central, eastern, and northern parts of the city. SARS-CoV-2 was also found in the treated effluent wastewater from the WWTP discharged into the recipient, the G\u00f6ta River, although with a reduction of 4-log 10. The viral peaks with regular temporal intervals indicated that SARS-CoV-2 may have a cluster spread, probably reflecting that the majority of infected persons only spread the disease during a few days. Our results are important for both the planning of hospital care and to rapidly identify and intervene against local spread of the virus.", "doi": "10.1016/j.watres.2020.116620", "pmid": "33212338", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Health": null, "Category: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "NA", "key": "Provided in the article: amount of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in Gothenburg per week between February and June 2020", "description": null}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-24T07:37:09.624Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:46:13.439Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "a47dbc0890e6411dbb49a80752e594ad", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/a47dbc0890e6411dbb49a80752e594ad.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/a47dbc0890e6411dbb49a80752e594ad"}}, "title": "EAES Recommendations for Recovery Plan in Minimally Invasive Surgery Amid COVID-19 Pandemic.", "authors": [{"family": "Arezzo", "given": "Alberto", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Francis", "given": "Nader", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Mintz", "given": "Yoav", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Adamina", "given": "Michel", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Antoniou", "given": "Stavros A", "initials": "SA"}, {"family": "Bouvy", "given": "Nicole", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Copaescu", "given": "Catalin", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "de Manzini", "given": "Nicol\u00f2", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Di Lorenzo", "given": "Nicola", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Morales-Conde", "given": "Salvador", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "M\u00fcller-Stich", "given": "Beat P", "initials": "BP"}, {"family": "Nickel", "given": "Felix", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Popa", "given": "Dorin", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Tait", "given": "Diana", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Thomas", "given": "Cenydd", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Nimmo", "given": "Susan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Paraskevis", "given": "Dimitrios", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Pietrabissa", "given": "Andrea", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "EAES Group of Experts for Recovery Amid COVID-19 Pandemic", "given": "", "initials": ""}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-11-10", "journal": {"title": "Surg Endosc", "issn": "1432-2218", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "COVID-19 pandemic presented an unexpected challenge for the surgical community in general and Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) specialists in particular.

Domain topics were formulated and subsequently subdivided into questions pertinent to different surgical specialities following the COVID-19 crisis. Sixty-five experts from 24 countries, representing the entire EAES board, were invited. Fifty clinicians and six engineers accepted the invitation and drafted statements based on specific key questions. Anonymous voting on the statements was performed until consensus was achieved, defined by at least 70% agreement.\n\nA total of 92 consensus statements were formulated with regard to safe resumption of surgery across eight domains, addressing general surgery, upper GI, lower GI, bariatrics, endocrine, HPB, abdominal wall and technology/research. The statements addressed elective and emergency services across all subspecialties with specific attention to the role of MIS during the recovery plan. Eighty-four of the statements were approved during the first round of Delphi voting (91.3%) and another 8 during the following round after substantial modification, resulting in a 100% consensus.\n\nThe recommendations formulated by the EAES board establish a framework for resumption of surgery following COVID-19 pandemic with particular focus on the role of MIS across surgical specialities.

The search for drugs that target RNA requires their high-resolution structural characterization. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, a worldwide consortium of NMR researchers aims to characterize potential RNA drug targets of SCoV2. Here, we report the characterization of 15 conserved RNA elements located at the 5' end, the ribosomal frameshift segment and the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the SCoV2 genome, their large-scale production and NMR-based secondary structure determination. The NMR data are corroborated with secondary structure probing by DMS footprinting experiments. The close agreement of NMR secondary structure determination of isolated RNA elements with DMS footprinting and NMR performed on larger RNA regions shows that the secondary structure elements fold independently.

Although current evidence does not suggest an atypical acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the physiological response to prone positioning is not fully understood and it is unclear which patients benefit. We aimed to determine whether proning increases oxygenation and to evaluate responders.\n\nThis case series from a single, tertiary university hospital includes all mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 and proning between 17 March 2020 and 19 May 2020. The primary measure was change in PaO 2 :FiO2 .\n\nForty-four patients, 32 males/12 females, were treated with proning for a total of 138 sessions, with median (range) two (1-8) sessions. Median (IQR) time for the five sessions was 14 (12-17) hours. In the first session, median (IQR) PaO 2 :FiO2 increased from 104 (86-122) to 161 (127-207) mm Hg (P < .001). 36/44 patients (82%) improved in PaO2 :FiO2 , with a significant increase in PaO2 :FiO2 in the first three sessions. Median (IQR) FiO2 decreased from 0.7 (0.6-0.8) to 0.5 (0.35-0.6) (<0.001). A significant decrease occurred in the first three sessions. PaO2 , tidal volumes, PEEP, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and norepinephrine infusion did not differ. Primarily, patients with PaO2 :FiO2 approximately < 120 mm Hg before treatment responded to proning.

Oxidative stress and its related metabolic syndromes are potential risk factors in the susceptibility to, and severity of COVID-19. In concert with the earliest reports of COVID-19, obstetricians started to diagnose and treat SARS-CoV-2 infections during pregnancy (\"COVID-19-Pregnancy\"). High metabolic demand to sustain normal fetal development increases the burden of oxidative stress in pregnancy. Intracellular redox changes intertwined with acute phase responses at the maternal-fetal interface could amplify during pregnancy. Interestingly, mother-to-fetus transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has not been detected in most of the COVID-19-Pregnancy cases. This relative absence of vertical transmission may be related to the presence of lactoferrin in the placenta, amniotic fluid, and lacteal secretions. However, the cytokine-storm induced during COVID-19-Pregnancy may cause severe inflammatory damage to the fetus, and if uncontrolled, may later result in autism spectrum-like disorders and brain development abnormalities in neonates. Considering this serious health threat to child growth and development, the prevention of COVID-19 during pregnancy should be considered a high priority.

Zoonotic viruses can directly be transferred from animals to humans through adaptation, followed by human-to-human transmission, such as in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and, more recently, SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), or they can be transferred through insects or vectors, as in the case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and dengue virus (DENV). At the present, there are no vaccines or antiviral compounds against most of these viruses. Because proteins possess a vast array of functions in all known biological systems, proteomics-based strategies can provide important insights into the investigation of disease pathogenesis and the identification of promising antiviral drug targets during an epidemic or pandemic. Mass spectrometry technology has provided the capacity required for the precise identification and the sensitive and high-throughput analysis of proteins on a large scale and has contributed greatly to unravelling key protein-protein interactions, discovering signaling networks, and understanding disease mechanisms. In this Review, we present an account of quantitative proteomics and its application in some prominent recent examples of emerging and re-emerging RNA virus diseases like HIV-1, CCHFV, ZIKV, and DENV, with more detail with respect to coronaviruses (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV) as well as the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.", "doi": "10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00380", "pmid": "33095583", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Funder: VR": null, "Category: Biochemistry": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7640957"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-01T15:33:37.364Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:45:02.967Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "facb78b4ec404e50a6986cb53cf8a3ec", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/facb78b4ec404e50a6986cb53cf8a3ec.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/facb78b4ec404e50a6986cb53cf8a3ec"}}, "title": "Searching for target-specific and multi-targeting organics for Covid-19 in the Drugbank database with a double scoring approach.", "authors": [{"family": "Murugan", "given": "Natarajan Arul", "initials": "NA"}, {"family": "Kumar", "given": "Sanjiv", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Jeyakanthan", "given": "Jeyaraman", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Srivastava", "given": "Vaibhav", "initials": "V"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-11-05", "journal": {"title": "Sci Rep", "issn": "2045-2322", "issn-l": "2045-2322", "volume": "10", "issue": "1", "pages": "19125"}, "abstract": "The current outbreak of Covid-19 infection due to SARS-CoV-2, a virus from the coronavirus family, has become a major threat to human healthcare. The virus has already infected more than 44 M people and the number of deaths reported has reached more than 1.1 M which may be attributed to lack of medicine. The traditional drug discovery approach involves many years of rigorous research and development and demands for a huge investment which cannot be adopted for the ongoing pandemic infection. Rather we need a swift and cost-effective approach to inhibit and control the viral infection. With the help of computational screening approaches and by choosing appropriate chemical space, it is possible to identify lead drug-like compounds for Covid-19. In this study, we have used the Drugbank database to screen compounds against the most important viral targets namely 3C-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the spike (S) protein. These targets play a major role in the replication/transcription and host cell recognition, therefore, are vital for the viral reproduction and spread of infection. As the structure based computational screening approaches are more reliable, we used the crystal structures for 3C-like main protease and spike protein. For the remaining targets, we used the structures based on homology modeling. Further, we employed two scoring methods based on binding free energies implemented in AutoDock Vina and molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area approach. Based on these results, we propose drug cocktails active against the three viral targets namely 3CLpro, PLpro and RdRp. Interestingly, one of the identified compounds in this study i.e. Baloxavir marboxil has been under clinical trial for the treatment of Covid-19 infection. In addition, we have identified a few compounds such as Phthalocyanine, Tadalafil, Lonafarnib, Nilotinib, Dihydroergotamine, R-428 which can bind to all three targets simultaneously and can serve as multi-targeting drugs. Our study also included calculation of binding energies for various compounds currently under drug trials. Among these compounds, it is found that Remdesivir binds to targets, 3CLpro and RdRp with high binding affinity. Moreover, Baricitinib and Umifenovir were found to have superior target-specific binding while Darunavir is found to be a potential multi-targeting drug. As far as we know this is the first study where the compounds from the Drugbank database are screened against four vital targets of SARS-CoV-2 and illustrates that the computational screening using a double scoring approach can yield potential drug-like compounds against Covid-19 infection.", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-75762-7", "pmid": "33154404", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Drug Discovery": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1038/s41598-020-75762-7"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7645721"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-01T14:46:02.174Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:45:25.943Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "d5b3f3d7bcd049fea392cd3db33852a2", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/d5b3f3d7bcd049fea392cd3db33852a2.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/d5b3f3d7bcd049fea392cd3db33852a2"}}, "title": "Effect and safety of Chinese herbal medicine granules in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective, single-center study with propensity score matching.", "authors": [{"family": "Wang", "given": "Yuanyuan", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Liu", "given": "Yuntao", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Lv", "given": "Qingquan", "initials": "Q"}, {"family": "Zheng", "given": "Danwen", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Zhou", "given": "Li", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Ouyang", "given": "Wenwei", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Ding", "given": "Banghan", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Zou", "given": "Xu", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "Yan", "given": "Fang", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Liu", "given": "Bo", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Chen", "given": "Jun", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Liu", "given": "Tianzhu", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Fu", "given": "Chicheng", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Fang", "given": "Qu", "initials": "Q"}, {"family": "Wang", "given": "Yi", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Li", "given": "Fang", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Chen", "given": "Ailan", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Lundborg", "given": "Cecilia St\u00e5lsby", "initials": "CS"}, {"family": "Guo", "given": "Jianwen", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Wen", "given": "Zehuai", "initials": "Z"}, {"family": "Zhang", "given": "Zhongde", "initials": "Z"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-11-05", "journal": {"title": "Phytomedicine", "issn": "1618-095X", "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": "153404", "issn-l": "0944-7113"}, "abstract": "Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has been used for severe illness caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but its treatment effects and safety are unclear.\n\nThis study reviews the effect and safety of CHM granules in the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19.\n\nWe conducteda single-center, retrospective study on patients with severe COVID-19 in a designated hospital in Wuhan from January 15, 2020 to March 30, 2020.

Identifying and supporting those most affected by the pandemic is required. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of the pandemic on individuals with tinnitus and to identify mediating factors. Methods: This is a mixed-methods exploratory cross-sectional study, using data collected via an online survey from 3,103 individuals with tinnitus from 48 countries. The greatest representation was from North America (49%) and Europe (47%) and other countries were only marginally represented. Results: Although the study was aimed at those with pre-existing tinnitus, 7 individuals reported having COVID-19 initiated tinnitus. Having COVID-19 symptoms exacerbated tinnitus in 40% of respondents, made no change in 54%, and improved tinnitus in 6%. Other mediating factors such as the social and emotional consequences of the pandemic made pre-existing tinnitus more bothersome for 32% of the respondents, particularly for females and younger adults, better for 1%, and caused no change to tinnitus for 67%. Pre-existing tinnitus was significantly exacerbated for those self-isolating, experiencing loneliness, sleeping poorly, and with reduced levels of exercise. Increased depression, anxiety, irritability, and financial worries further significantly contributed to tinnitus being more bothersome during the pandemic period. Conclusions: These findings have implications for tinnitus management, because they highlight the diverse response both internal and external factors have on tinnitus levels. Clinical services should be mindful that tinnitus may be caused by contracting COVID-19 and pre-existing tinnitus may be exacerbated, although in the majority of respondents there was no change.

Remaining circulating ILCs from patients revealed increased frequencies of ILC2 in moderate COVID-19, with a concomitant decrease of ILC precursors (ILCp), as compared with controls. ILC2 and ILCp showed an activated phenotype with increased CD69 expression, whereas expression levels of the chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR4 were significantly altered in ILC2 and ILCp, and ILC1, respectively.

The virus spread rapidly, particularly in the North of the country in the 'Padan Plain' area, known as one of the most polluted regions in Europe. Air pollution has been recently hypothesized to enhance the clinical severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, acting through adverse effects on immunity, induction of respiratory and other chronic disease, upregulation of viral receptor ACE-2, and possible pathogen transportation as a virus carrier. We investigated the association between air pollution and subsequent COVID-19 mortality rates within two Italian regions (Veneto and Emilia-Romagna). We estimated ground-level nitrogen dioxide through its tropospheric levels using data available from the Sentinel-5P satellites of the European Space Agency Copernicus Earth Observation Programme before the lockdown. We then examined COVID-19 mortality rates in relation to the nitrogen dioxide levels at three 14-day lag points after the lockdown, namely March 8, 22 and April 5, 2020. Using a multivariable negative binomial regression model, we found an association between nitrogen dioxide and COVID-19 mortality.

Secondary aims included the association of bio-ADM with organ failure and the ability of bio-ADM to identify sepsis.\n\nIn this retrospective observational study, adult patients admitted to one of four ICUs during 2016 had admission bio-ADM levels analysed. Age-adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95% CI for log-2 transformed bio-ADM, and Youden's index derived cut-offs were calculated. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality, and secondary outcomes included the need for organ support and the ability to identify sepsis.\n\nBio-ADM in 1867 consecutive patients were analysed; 632 patients fulfilled the sepsis-3 criteria of whom 267 had septic shock.

Design: Systematic analysis. Data sources: Worldometer, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, United Nations Main outcome measures: The explanators of nDpm and CFR were mathematically hypothesised and tested on publicly-available data from 88 countries with linear regression models on May 1st 2020. The derived explanators - age-adjusted infection fatality rate (IFRadj) and case detection rate (CDR) - were estimated for each country based on a SARS-CoV-2 model of China. The accuracy and agreement of the models with observed data was assessed with R2 and Bland-Altman plots, respectively. Sensitivity analyses involved removal of outliers and testing the models at five retrospective and two prospective time points. Results: Globally, IFRadj estimates varied between countries, ranging from below 0.2% in the youngest nations, to above 1.3% in Portugal, Greece, Italy, and Japan. The median estimated global CDR of SARS-CoV-2 infections on April 16th 2020 was 12.9%, suggesting that most of the countries have a much higher number of cases than reported. At least 93% and up to 99% of the variance in nDpm was explained by reported prevalence expressed as cases per million citizens (nCpm), IFRadj, and CDR. IFRadj and CDR accounted for up to 97% of the variance in CFR, but this model was less reliable than the nDpm model, being sensitive to outliers (R2 as low as 67.5%).

We describe the nature and context of the decision-making and analysed how doctors make intensive care admission decisions. Such decisions are complex with intrinsic uncertainty, often urgent and made with incomplete information. While doctors aspire to make patient-centred decisions, key challenges include: being overworked with lack of time; limited support from senior staff; and a lack of adequate staffing in other parts of the hospital that may be compromising patient safety. To reduce decision complexity, heuristic rules based on experience are often used to help think through the problem; for example, the patient's functional status or clinical gestalt. The intensive care doctors actively managed relationships with referring doctors; acted as the hospital generalist for acutely ill patients; and brought calm to crisis situations. However, they frequently failed to elicit values and preferences from patients or family members. They were rarely explicit in balancing burdens and benefits of intensive care for patients, so consistency and equity cannot be judged. The use of a framework for intensive care admission decisions that reminds doctors to seek patient or family views and encourages explicit balancing of burdens and benefits could improve decision-making.

In this study, we analyzed Ab-secreting cell and Ab responses in 20 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The patients exhibited typical symptoms of COVID-19 and presented with reduced lymphocyte numbers and increased T cell and B cell activation. Importantly, we detected an expansion of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein\u2013specific Ab-secreting cells in all 20 COVID-19 patients using a multicolor FluoroSpot Assay.

Specifically, 32 compounds isolated from 14 cooking seasonings were examined as inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro), which is required for viral multiplication. Using a drug discovery approach to identify possible antiviral leads, in silico molecular docking studies were performed. Docking calculations revealed a high potency of salvianolic acid A and curcumin as Mpro inhibitors with binding energies of -9.7 and -9.2 kcal/mol, respectively. Binding mode analysis demonstrated the ability of salvianolic acid A and curcumin to form nine and six hydrogen bonds, respectively with amino acids proximal to Mpro's active site. Stabilities and binding affinities of the two identified natural spices were calculated over 40 ns molecular dynamics simulations and compared to an antiviral protease inhibitor (lopinavir). Molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area energy calculations revealed greater salvianolic acid A affinity for the enzyme over curcumin and lopinavir with energies of -44.8, -34.2 and -34.8 kcal/mol, respectively. Using a STRING database, protein-protein interactions were identified for salvianolic acid A included the biochemical signaling genes ACE, MAPK14 and ESR1; and for curcumin, EGFR and TNF.

A suite of preventive behaviours have been recommended to minimize risk of COVID-19 infection in the general population. The present study utilized an integrated social cognition model to explain COVID-19 preventive behaviours in a sample from the Iranian general population.\n\nThe study adopted a three-wave prospective correlational design.\n\nMembers of the general public (N = 1,718, M age = 33.34, SD = 15.77, male = 796, female = 922) agreed to participate in the study. Participants completed self-report measures of demographic characteristics, intention, attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, and action self-efficacy at an initial data collection occasion. One week later, participants completed self-report measures of maintenance self-efficacy, action planning and coping planning, and, a further week later, measures of COVID-19 preventive behaviours. Hypothesized relationships among social cognition constructs and COVID-19 preventive behaviours according to the proposed integrated model were estimated using structural equation modelling.\n\nThe proposed model fitted the data well according to multiple goodness-of-fit criteria. All proposed relationships among model constructs were statistically significant. The social cognition constructs with the largest effects on COVID-19 preventive behaviours were coping planning (\u03b2 = .575, p < .001) and action planning (\u03b2 = .267, p < .001).\n\nCurrent findings may inform the development of behavioural interventions in health care contexts by identifying intervention targets. In particular, findings suggest targeting change in coping planning and action planning may be most effective in promoting participation in COVID-19 preventive behaviours. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Curbing COVID-19 infections globally is vital to reduce severe cases and deaths in at-risk groups. Preventive behaviours like handwashing and social distancing can stem contagion of the coronavirus. Identifying modifiable correlates of COVID-19 preventive behaviours is needed to inform intervention. What does this study add? An integrated model identified predictors of COVID-19 preventive behaviours in Iranian residents. Prominent predictors were intentions, planning, self-efficacy, and perceived behavioural control. Findings provide insight into potentially modifiable constructs that interventions can target. Research should examine if targeting these factors lead to changes in COVID-19 behaviours over time.", "doi": "10.1111/bjhp.12465", "pmid": "32780891", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7436576"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-07T13:30:27.584Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:46:13.514Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "c7b5d0c782d34b6b8e7f92788ee11cde", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/c7b5d0c782d34b6b8e7f92788ee11cde.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/c7b5d0c782d34b6b8e7f92788ee11cde"}}, "title": "COVID-19 puts the Sustainable Development Goals center stage.", "authors": [{"family": "Ottersen", "given": "Ole Petter", "initials": "OP"}, {"family": "Engebretsen", "given": "Eivind", "initials": "E"}], "type": "letter", "published": "2020-11-00", "journal": {"title": "Nat Med", "issn": "1546-170X", "issn-l": "1078-8956", "volume": "26", "issue": "11", "pages": "1672-1673"}, "abstract": "Correspondence", "doi": "10.1038/s41591-020-1094-y", "pmid": "33037423", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1038/s41591-020-1094-y"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-01T17:24:14.636Z", "modified": "2020-12-01T17:24:43.108Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "c16a784427d3471e850b91eee6e6a91d", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/c16a784427d3471e850b91eee6e6a91d.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/c16a784427d3471e850b91eee6e6a91d"}}, "title": "Complement C3 vs C5 inhibition in severe COVID-19: Early clinical findings reveal differential biological efficacy.", "authors": [{"family": "Mastellos", "given": "Dimitrios C", "initials": "DC"}, {"family": "Pires da Silva", "given": "Bruno G P", "initials": "BGP"}, {"family": "Fonseca", "given": "Benedito A L", "initials": "BAL"}, {"family": "Fonseca", "given": "Natasha P", "initials": "NP"}, {"family": "Auxiliadora-Martins", "given": "Maria", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Mastaglio", "given": "Sara", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Ruggeri", "given": "Annalisa", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Sironi", "given": "Marina", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Radermacher", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Chrysanthopoulou", "given": "Akrivi", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Skendros", "given": "Panagiotis", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Ritis", "given": "Konstantinos", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Manfra", "given": "Ilenia", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Iacobelli", "given": "Simona", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Huber-Lang", "given": "Markus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Bo", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Yancopoulou", "given": "Despina", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Connolly", "given": "E Sander", "initials": "ES"}, {"family": "Garlanda", "given": "Cecilia", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Ciceri", "given": "Fabio", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Risitano", "given": "Antonio M", "initials": "AM"}, {"family": "Calado", "given": "Rodrigo T", "initials": "RT"}, {"family": "Lambris", "given": "John D", "initials": "JD"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-11-00", "journal": {"title": "Clin Immunol", "issn": "1521-7035", "issn-l": "1521-6616", "volume": "220", "issue": null, "pages": "108598"}, "abstract": "Growing clinical evidence has implicated complement as a pivotal driver of COVID-19 immunopathology. Deregulated complement activation may fuel cytokine-driven hyper-inflammation, thrombotic microangiopathy and NET-driven immunothrombosis, thereby leading to multi-organ failure. Complement therapeutics have gained traction as candidate drugs for countering the detrimental consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whether blockade of terminal complement effectors (C5, C5a, or C5aR1) may elicit similar outcomes to upstream intervention at the level of C3 remains debated. Here we compare the efficacy of the C5-targeting monoclonal antibody eculizumab with that of the compstatin-based C3-targeted drug candidate AMY-101 in small independent cohorts of severe COVID-19 patients. Our exploratory study indicates that therapeutic complement inhibition abrogates COVID-19 hyper-inflammation. Both C3 and C5 inhibitors elicit a robust anti-inflammatory response, reflected by a steep decline in C-reactive protein and IL-6 levels, marked lung function improvement, and resolution of SARS-CoV-2-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). C3 inhibition afforded broader therapeutic control in COVID-19 patients by attenuating both C3a and sC5b-9 generation and preventing FB consumption. This broader inhibitory profile was associated with a more robust decline of neutrophil counts, attenuated neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release, faster serum LDH decline, and more prominent lymphocyte recovery. These early clinical results offer important insights into the differential mechanistic basis and underlying biology of C3 and C5 inhibition in COVID-19 and point to a broader pathogenic involvement of C3-mediated pathways in thromboinflammation.

The aim of this study was to investigate how individual-level housing and neighbourhood characteristics are associated with COVID-19 mortality in older adults.\n\nFor this population-based, observational study, we used data from the cause-of-death register held by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare to identify recorded COVID-19 mortality and mortality from other causes among individuals (aged \u226570 years) in Stockholm county, Sweden, between March 12 and May 8, 2020. This information was linked to population-register data from December, 2019, including socioeconomic, demographic, and residential characteristics. We ran Cox proportional hazards regressions for the risk of dying from COVID-19 and from all other causes. The independent variables were area (m 2) per individual in the household, the age structure of the household, type of housing, confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the borough, and neighbourhood population density. All models were adjusted for individual age, sex, country of birth, income, and education.\n\nOf 279 961 individuals identified to be aged 70 years or older on March 12, 2020, and residing in Stockholm in December, 2019, 274 712 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the study population. Between March 12 and May 8, 2020, 3386 deaths occurred, of which 1301 were reported as COVID-19 deaths. In fully adjusted models, household and neighbourhood characteristics were independently associated with COVID-19 mortality among older adults. Compared with living in a household with individuals aged 66 years or older, living with someone of working age (<66 years) was associated with increased COVID-19 mortality (hazard ratio 1\u00b76; 95% CI 1\u00b73-2\u00b70). Living in a care home was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality (4\u00b71; 3\u00b75-4\u00b79) compared with living in independent housing. Living in neighbourhoods with the highest population density (\u22655000 individuals per km 2) was associated with higher COVID-19 mortality (1\u00b77; 1\u00b71-2\u00b74) compared with living in the least densely populated neighbourhoods (0 to <150 individuals per km2).\n\nClose exposure to working-age household members and neighbours is associated with increased COVID-19 mortality among older adults. Similarly, living in a care home is associated with increased mortality, potentially through exposure to visitors and care workers, but also due to poor underlying health among care-home residents. These factors should be considered when developing strategies to protect this group.\n\nSwedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare (FORTE), Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences.", "doi": "10.1016/S2666-7568(20)30016-7", "pmid": "33521770", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S2666-7568(20)30016-7"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7832817"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-02-04T18:25:32.385Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:45:48.566Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "a3e7cb41d6e1464a9318407386ba4762", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/a3e7cb41d6e1464a9318407386ba4762.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/a3e7cb41d6e1464a9318407386ba4762"}}, "title": "Converging pathways in pulmonary fibrosis and Covid-19 - The fibrotic link to disease severity.", "authors": [{"family": "Wig\u00e9n", "given": "Jenny", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "L\u00f6fdahl", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Bjermer", "given": "Leif", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Elowsson-Rendin", "given": "Linda", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Westergren-Thorsson", "given": "Gunilla", "initials": "G"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-11-00", "journal": {"title": "Respir Med X", "issn": "2590-1435", "volume": "2", "issue": null, "pages": "100023", "issn-l": "2590-1435"}, "abstract": "As Covid-19 affects millions of people worldwide, the global health care will encounter an increasing burden of the aftermaths of the disease. Evidence shows that up to a fifth of the patients develop fibrotic tissue in the lung. The SARS outbreak in the early 2000 resulted in chronic pulmonary fibrosis in a subset (around 4%) of the patients, and correlated to reduced lung function and forced expiratory volume (FEV). The similarities between corona virus infections causing SARS and Covid-19 are striking, except that the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has proven to have an even higher communicability. This would translate into a large number of patients seeking care for clinical signs of pulmonary fibrosis, given that the Covid-19 pandemic has up till now (Sept 2020) affected around 30 million people. The SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is part of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Downregulation of ACE2 upon virus binding disturbs downstream activities of RAS resulting in increased inflammation and development of fibrosis. The poor prognosis and risk of developing pulmonary fibrosis are therefore associated with the increased expression of ACE2 in risk groups, such as obesity, heart disorders and aging, conferring plenty of binding opportunity for the virus and subsequently the internalization of ACE2, thus devoiding the enzyme from acting counter-inflammatory and antifibrotic. Identifying pathways that are associated with Covid-19 severity that result in pulmonary fibrosis may enable early diagnosis and individualized treatment for these patients to prevent or reduce irreversible fibrotic damage to the lung.", "doi": "10.1016/j.yrmex.2020.100023", "pmid": "33083782", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S2590-1435(20)30010-5"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7546672"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-27T11:49:56.303Z", "modified": "2020-11-27T11:49:56.325Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "a107d4a9a1434c93ba1cbee8a5c6ca16", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/a107d4a9a1434c93ba1cbee8a5c6ca16.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/a107d4a9a1434c93ba1cbee8a5c6ca16"}}, "title": "Risks to healthcare workers following tracheal intubation of patients with COVID-19: a prospective international multicentre cohort study.", "authors": [{"family": "El-Boghdadly", "given": "K", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Wong", "given": "D J N", "initials": "DJN"}, {"family": "Owen", "given": "R", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Neuman", "given": "M D", "initials": "MD"}, {"family": "Pocock", "given": "S", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Carlisle", "given": "J B", "initials": "JB"}, {"family": "Johnstone", "given": "C", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Andruszkiewicz", "given": "P", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Baker", "given": "P A", "initials": "PA"}, {"family": "Biccard", "given": "B M", "initials": "BM"}, {"family": "Bryson", "given": "G L", "initials": "GL"}, {"family": "Chan", "given": "M T V", "initials": "MTV"}, {"family": "Cheng", "given": "M H", "initials": "MH"}, {"family": "Chin", "given": "K J", "initials": "KJ"}, {"family": "Coburn", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Jonsson Fagerlund", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Myatra", "given": "S N", "initials": "SN"}, {"family": "Myles", "given": "P S", "initials": "PS"}, {"family": "O'Sullivan", "given": "E", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Pasin", "given": "L", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Shamim", "given": "F", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "van Klei", "given": "W A", "initials": "WA"}, {"family": "Ahmad", "given": "I", "initials": "I"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-11-00", "journal": {"title": "Anaesthesia", "issn": "1365-2044", "volume": "75", "issue": "11", "pages": "1437-1447", "issn-l": "0003-2409"}, "abstract": "Healthcare workers involved in aerosol-generating procedures, such as tracheal intubation, may be at elevated risk of acquiring COVID-19.

a drug commonly used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, has received much negative publicity for adverse events associated with its authorisation for emergency use to treat patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. We studied the safety of hydroxychloroquine, alone and in combination with azithromycin, to determine the risk associated with its use in routine care in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nIn this multinational, retrospective study, new user cohort studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis aged 18 years or older and initiating hydroxychloroquine were compared with those initiating sulfasalazine and followed up over 30 days, with 16 severe adverse events studied. Self-controlled case series were done to further establish safety in wider populations, and included all users of hydroxychloroquine regardless of rheumatoid arthritis status or indication. Separately, severe adverse events associated with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin (compared with hydroxychloroquine plus amoxicillin) were studied. Data comprised 14 sources of claims data or electronic medical records from Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, and the USA. Propensity score stratification and calibration using negative control outcomes were used to address confounding. Cox models were fitted to estimate calibrated hazard ratios (HRs) according to drug use. Estimates were pooled where the I2 value was less than 0\u00b74.\n\nThe study included 956 374 users of hydroxychloroquine, 310 350 users of sulfasalazine, 323 122 users of hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, and 351 956 users of hydroxychloroquine plus amoxicillin. No excess risk of severe adverse events was identified when 30-day hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine use were compared. Self-controlled case series confirmed these findings. However, long-term use of hydroxychloroquine appeared to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality (calibrated HR 1\u00b765 [95% CI 1\u00b712-2\u00b744]). Addition of azithromycin appeared to be associated with an increased risk of 30-day cardiovascular mortality (calibrated HR 2\u00b719 [95% CI 1\u00b722-3\u00b795]), chest pain or angina (1\u00b715 [1\u00b705-1\u00b726]), and heart failure (1\u00b722 [1\u00b702-1\u00b745]).\n\nHydroxychloroquine treatment appears to have no increased risk in the short term among patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but in the long term it appears to be associated with excess cardiovascular mortality. The addition of azithromycin increases the risk of heart failure and cardiovascular mortality even in the short term. We call for careful consideration of the benefit-risk trade-off when counselling those on hydroxychloroquine treatment.\n\nNational Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, NIHR Senior Research Fellowship programme, US National Institutes of Health, US Department of Veterans Affairs, Janssen Research and Development, IQVIA, Korea Health Industry Development Institute through the Ministry of Health and Welfare Republic of Korea, Versus Arthritis, UK Medical Research Council Doctoral Training Partnership, Foundation Alfonso Martin Escudero, Innovation Fund Denmark, Novo Nordisk Foundation, Singapore Ministry of Health's National Medical Research Council Open Fund Large Collaborative Grant, VINCI, Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking, EU's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, and European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations.", "doi": "10.1016/S2665-9913(20)30276-9", "pmid": "32864627", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "URL", "key": "http://evidence.ohdsi.org:3838/Covid19EstimationHydroxychloroquine/", "description": "Data aggregated by data source"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-07T10:13:23.488Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:45:48.505Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "99a5591d953744048ca94c23f5b35e2a", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/99a5591d953744048ca94c23f5b35e2a.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/99a5591d953744048ca94c23f5b35e2a"}}, "title": "Outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection in liver transplant recipients: an international registry study.", "authors": [{"family": "Webb", "given": "Gwilym J", "initials": "GJ"}, {"family": "Marjot", "given": "Thomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Cook", "given": "Jonathan A", "initials": "JA"}, {"family": "Aloman", "given": "Costica", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Armstrong", "given": "Matthew J", "initials": "MJ"}, {"family": "Brenner", "given": "Erica J", "initials": "EJ"}, {"family": "Catana", "given": "Maria-Andreea", "initials": "MA"}, {"family": "Cargill", "given": "Tamsin", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Dhanasekaran", "given": "Renumathy", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Garc\u00eda-Ju\u00e1rez", "given": "Ignacio", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Hagstr\u00f6m", "given": "Hannes", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Kennedy", "given": "James M", "initials": "JM"}, {"family": "Marshall", "given": "Aileen", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Masson", "given": "Steven", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Mercer", "given": "Carolyn J", "initials": "CJ"}, {"family": "Perumalswami", "given": "Ponni V", "initials": "PV"}, {"family": "Ruiz", "given": "Isaac", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Thaker", "given": "Sarang", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Ufere", "given": "Nneka N", "initials": "NN"}, {"family": "Barnes", "given": "Eleanor", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Barritt", "given": "Alfred S", "initials": "AS"}, {"family": "Moon", "given": "Andrew M", "initials": "AM"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-11-00", "journal": {"title": "Lancet Gastroenterol Hepatol", "issn": "2468-1253", "volume": "5", "issue": "11", "pages": "1008-1016", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Despite concerns that patients with liver transplants might be at increased risk of adverse outcomes from COVID-19 because of coexisting comorbidities and use of immunosuppressants, the effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on this patient group remains unclear. We aimed to assess the clinical outcomes in these patients.\n\nIn this multicentre cohort study, we collected data on patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, who were older than 18 years, who had previously received a liver transplant, and for whom data had been submitted by clinicians to one of two international registries (COVID-Hep and SECURE-Cirrhosis) at the end of the patient's disease course. Patients without a known hospitalisation status or mortality outcome were excluded. For comparison, data from a contemporaneous cohort of consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who had not received a liver transplant were collected from the electronic patient records of the Oxford University Hospitals National Health Service Foundation Trust. We compared the cohorts with regard to several outcomes (including death, hospitalisation, intensive care unit [ICU] admission, requirement for intensive care, and need for invasive ventilation). A propensity score-matched analysis was done to test for an association between liver transplant and death.\n\nBetween March 25 and June 26, 2020, data were collected for 151 adult liver transplant recipients from 18 countries (median age 60 years [IQR 47-66], 102 [68%] men, 49 [32%] women) and 627 patients who had not undergone liver transplantation (median age 73 years [44-84], 329 [52%] men, 298 [48%] women). The groups did not differ with regard to the proportion of patients hospitalised (124 [82%] patients in the liver transplant cohort vs 474 [76%] in the comparison cohort, p=0\u00b7106), or who required intensive care (47 [31%] vs 185 [30%], p=0\u00b7837). However, ICU admission (43 [28%] vs 52 [8%], p<0\u00b70001) and invasive ventilation (30 [20%] vs 32 [5%], p<0\u00b70001) were more frequent in the liver transplant cohort. 28 (19%) patients in the liver transplant cohort died, compared with 167 (27%) in the comparison cohort (p=0\u00b7046). In the propensity score-matched analysis (adjusting for age, sex, creatinine concentration, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and ethnicity), liver transplantation did not significantly increase the risk of death in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (absolute risk difference 1\u00b74% [95% CI -7\u00b77 to 10\u00b74]). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that age (odds ratio 1\u00b706 [95% CI 1\u00b701 to 1\u00b711] per 1 year increase), serum creatinine concentration (1\u00b757 [1\u00b705 to 2\u00b736] per 1 mg/dL increase), and non-liver cancer (18\u00b730 [1\u00b796 to 170\u00b775]) were associated with death among liver transplant recipients.\n\nLiver transplantation was not independently associated with death, whereas increased age and presence of comorbidities were.

However, data are scarce on the association between multiple types of pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders and COVID-19. We aimed to assess the association between pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders and the subsequent risk of COVID-19 using UK Biobank.\n\nFor this cohort analysis, we included participants from UK Biobank who were registered in England and excluded individuals who died before Jan 31, 2020, (the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK) or had withdrawn from UK Biobank. Participants diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder before Jan 31 were included in the group of individuals with pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders, whereas participants without a diagnosis before the outbreak were included in the group of individuals without pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders. We used the Public Health England dataset, UK Biobank hospital data, and death registers to collect data on COVID-19 cases. To examine the relationship between pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders and susceptibility to COVID-19, we used logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs), controlling for multiple confounders and somatic comorbidities. Key outcomes were all COVID-19, COVID-19 specifically diagnosed in inpatient care, and COVID-19-related deaths. ORs were also estimated separately for each psychiatric disorder and on the basis of the number of pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders. As a positive disease control, we repeated analyses for hospitalisation for other infections.\n\nWe included 421 014 UK Biobank participants in our study and assessed their COVID-19 status between Jan 31 and July 26, 2020. 50 809 participants were diagnosed with psychiatric disorders before the outbreak, while 370 205 participants had no psychiatric disorders. The mean age at outbreak was 67\u00b780 years (SD 8\u00b712). We observed an elevated risk of COVID-19 among individuals with pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders compared with that of individuals without such conditions. The fully adjusted ORs were 1\u00b744 (95% CI 1\u00b728-1\u00b762) for All COVID-19 cases, 1\u00b755 (1\u00b734-1\u00b778) for Inpatient COVID-19 cases, and 2\u00b703 (1\u00b759-2\u00b759) for COVID-19-related deaths. We observed excess risk, defined as risk that increased with the number of pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders, across all diagnostic categories of pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders. We also observed an association between psychiatric disorders and elevated risk of hospitalisation due to other infections (OR 1\u00b774, 95% CI 1\u00b758-1\u00b793).\n\nOur findings suggest that pre-existing psychiatric disorders are associated with an increased risk of COVID-19. These findings underscore the need for surveillance of and care for populations with pre-existing psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nNational Natural Science Foundation of China.", "doi": "10.1016/S2666-7568(20)30013-1", "pmid": "33521769", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Public Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S2666-7568(20)30013-1"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7832159"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-02-04T18:27:04.421Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:47:00.051Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "884d64d5e3ab4443b5b428260d57c4e9", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/884d64d5e3ab4443b5b428260d57c4e9.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/884d64d5e3ab4443b5b428260d57c4e9"}}, "title": "Virological surveillance of influenza viruses in the WHO European Region in 2019/20 - impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "authors": [{"family": "Melidou", "given": "Angeliki", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Pereyaslov", "given": "Dmitriy", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Hungnes", "given": "Olav", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Prosenc", "given": "Katarina", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Alm", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Adlhoch", "given": "Cornelia", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Fielding", "given": "James", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Sneiderman", "given": "Miriam", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Martinuka", "given": "Oksana", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Celentano", "given": "Lucia Pastore", "initials": "LP"}, {"family": "Pebody", "given": "Richard", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "WHO European Region influenza surveillance network", "given": "", "initials": ""}, {"family": "WHO European Region Influenza Surveillance Network author list", "given": "", "initials": ""}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-11-00", "journal": {"title": "Euro Surveill", "issn": "1560-7917", "issn-l": null, "volume": "25", "issue": "46", "pages": null}, "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the 2019/20 WHO European Region influenza surveillance.

The International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) formed a panel of experts to develop consensus recommendations on the implications of the pandemic on several aspects of cancer care in this age group including geriatric assessment (GA), surgery, radiotherapy, systemic treatment, palliative care and research. Age and cancer diagnosis are significant predictors of adverse outcomes of the COVID-19 infection. In this setting, GA is particularly valuable to drive decision-making. GA may aid estimating physiologic reserve and adaptive capability, assessing risk-benefits of either providing or temporarily withholding treatments, and determining patient preferences to help inform treatment decisions. In a resource-constrained setting, geriatric screening tools may be administered remotely to identify patients requiring comprehensive GA. Tele-health is also crucial to ensure adequate continuity of care and minimize the risk of infection exposure. In general, therapeutic decisions should favor the most effective and least invasive approach with the lowest risk of adverse outcomes.

The discussion also explores why anti-vaccine sentiments are on the rise, and how members of the scientific and medical community require a more structured approach to communicating key arguments. This is particularly important if vaccination rates and herd immunity are to be sustained.

It created many issues around the optimal and safest way to treat complex patients with severe allergic disease. A significant number of the patients are on treatment with biologicals, and clinicians face the challenge to provide optimal care during the pandemic. Uncertainty of the potential risks for these patients is related to the fact that the exact sequence of immunological events during SARS-CoV-2 is not known. Severe COVID-19 patients may experience a \"cytokine storm\" and associated organ damage characterized by an exaggerated release of pro-inflammatory type 1 and type 3 cytokines. These inflammatory responses are potentially counteracted by anti-inflammatory cytokines and type 2 responses. This expert-based EAACI statement aims to provide guidance on the application of biologicals targeting type 2 inflammation in patients with allergic disease. Currently, there is very little evidence for an enhanced risk of patients with allergic diseases to develop severe COVID-19. Studies focusing on severe allergic phenotypes are lacking. At present, noninfected patients on biologicals for the treatment of asthma, atopic dermatitis, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, or chronic spontaneous urticaria should continue their biologicals targeting type 2 inflammation via self-application. In case of an active SARS-CoV-2 infection, biological treatment needs to be stopped until clinical recovery and SARS-CoV-2 negativity is established and treatment with biologicals should be re-initiated.

Contrary to our predictions, the observed partisan gap strengthened over time and remained when stay-at-home orders were active. Additionally, county-level consumption of conservative media (Fox News) was related to reduced physical distancing. Finally, the observed partisan differences in distancing were associated with subsequently higher COVID-19 infection and fatality growth rates in pro-Trump counties.

Disjuncture is a concept proposed by adult educator Peter Jarvis to describe the phenomenon of what happens when an individual is confronted with an experience that conflicts with her/his previous understanding of the world. Faced with a situation that creates disjuncture, the person is compelled to find new knowledge and new ways of doing things; i.e., he/she must embark on a learning process. The recent introduction of social distancing as a measure aiming to reduce transmission of the COVID-19 virus has dramatically changed people's behaviour, but this measure does not only have preventive and desirable effects. There is an associated risk for increased isolation among the older generations of the population, as well as a change in intergenerational relationships. Although the current pandemic (as disjuncture) may potentially initiate major learning processes in the human collective, we should remember that disjuncture is often theorised within neutral, or even positive, contexts. In a context of fear, however, learning may result in a narrowing of mindsets and a rejection of collective efforts and solidarity between generations. In terms of the types of learning triggered by the current pandemic (as disjuncture), one problem is non-reflective learning, which primarily occurs on a behavioural level. We need to recognise this and engage in reflective learning if we are to make the choices that will lead to a society that is worth living in for all generations.

The Huddinge site at the Karolinska university hospital (KH) responded through a rapid transformation of inpatient care capacity together with changing working methods in the ED. The aim is to describe the KH response to the COVID-19 crisis, and how ED crowding, and important input, throughput and output factors for ED crowding developed at KH during a 30-day baseline period followed by the first 60 days of the COVID-19 outbreak in Stockholm Region.\n\nDifferent phases in the development of the crisis were described and identified retrospectively based on major events that changed the conditions for the ED. Results were presented for each phase separately. The outcome ED length of stay (ED LOS) was calculated with mean and 95% confidence intervals. Input, throughput, output and demographic factors were described using distributions, proportions and means. Pearson correlation between ED LOS and emergency ward occupancy by phase was estimated with 95% confidence interval.\n\nAs new working methods were introduced between phase 2 and 3, ED LOS declined from mean (95% CI) 386 (373-399) minutes to 307 (297-317).

Another important factor was the reduction in bed occupancy in emergency wards that enabled a timely admission to inpatient care.

These systems center on the premise that the public is engaged and informed about the immunization process beyond their interaction with primary care, and that they will be a contributor and auditor of immunization data. The digital immunization system of the future will facilitate reporting of adverse events following immunization, issue digital immunization receipts, permit identification of areas of need and allow for delivery of interventions targeting these areas. Through features like immunization reminders and targeted immunization promotion campaigns, the system will reduce many of the known barriers that influence immunization rates.

prevalence of physical and psychiatric comorbidities and experience early-onset dementia. With the outbreak of CoVID-19 pandemic, strict social isolation measures have been necessary to prevent the spreading of the disease. Effects of this lockdown period on behavior, mood and cognition in people with DS have not been assessed so far. In the present clinical study, we investigated the impact of CoVID-19-related lockdown on psychosocial, cognitive and functional well-being in a sample population of 46 adults with DS. The interRAI Intellectual Disability standardized assessment instrument, which includes measures of social withdrawal, functional impairment, aggressive behavior and depressive symptoms, was used to perform a three time-point evaluation (two pre-lockdown and one post-lockdown) in 37 subjects of the study sample, and a two time point evaluation (one pre- and one post-lockdown) in 9 subjects. Two mixed linear regression models - one before and one after the lockdown - have been fitted for each scale in order to investigate the change in the time-dependent variation of the scores. In the pre-lockdown period, significant worsening over time (i.e., per year) was found for the Depression Rating Scale score (\u03b2 = 0.55; 95% CI 0.34; 0.76). In the post-lockdown period, a significant worsening in social withdrawal (\u03b2 = 3.05, 95% CI 0.39; 5.70), instrumental activities of daily living (\u03b2 = 1.13, 95% CI 0.08; 2.18) and depression rating (\u03b2 = 1.65, 95% CI 0.33; 2.97) scales scores was observed, as was a significant improvement in aggressive behavior (\u03b2 = -1.40, 95% CI -2.69; -0.10). Despite the undoubtful importance of the lockdown in order to reduce the spreading of the CoVID-19 pandemic, the related social isolation measures suggest an exacerbation of depressive symptoms and a worsening in functional status in a sample of adults with DS. At the opposite, aggressive behavior was reduced after the lockdown period. This finding could be related to the increase of negative and depressive symptoms in the study population. Studies with longer follow-up period are needed to assess persistence of these effects.", "doi": "10.3389/fpsyt.2020.578686", "pmid": "33192717", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7655916"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-27T09:55:50.227Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:45:47.853Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "83fad77501a1445eb5aea9d17c557e17", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/83fad77501a1445eb5aea9d17c557e17.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/83fad77501a1445eb5aea9d17c557e17"}}, "title": "On the relationship between BCG coverage and national Covid-19 outcome: could \"heterologous\" herd immunity explain why some countries are better off?", "authors": [{"family": "Lerm", "given": "Maria", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-10-27", "journal": {"title": "J Intern Med", "issn": "1365-2796", "volume": "288", "issue": "6", "pages": "682-688", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "The Covid-19 pandemic has affected most parts of the global society since its emergence and the scientific community has been challenged with challenging questions urgently demanding answers.

In the present work, I demonstrate a strong correlation between the number of years that countries implemented BCG vaccination plans and age-standardised mortality rates during the first months of the pandemic in Europe. Further analyses of age groups in two European countries with comparably few confounding factors and easily identifiable groups of BCG-vaccinated and non-vaccinated subgroups suggest a population-level effect of BCG on national outcomes of Covid-19.

The overall number and percentage of exfoliative and fine-needle aspiration cytology samples from each anatomic site were recorded. Differences in the malignancy and suspicious rates between the 2 periods were analyzed using a meta-analytical approach.\n\nOverall, the sample volume was lower compared with 2019 (104,319 samples vs 190,225 samples), with an average volume reduction of 45.3% (range, 0.1%-98.0%).

Jordan has implemented strict nationwide control measures to halt the viral spread, one of which was the closure of universities and shifting to remote teaching. The impact of this pandemic could extend beyond the risk of physical harm to substantial psychological consequences. Our study aimed at assessing 1) psychological status, 2) challenges of distance teaching, and 3) coping activities and pandemic-related concerns among university teachers in Jordan in the midst of COVID-19-related quarantine and control measures. We conducted a cross-sectional study using an anonymous online survey. The measure of psychological distress was obtained using a validated Arabic version of the Kessler Distress Scale (K10). Other information collected included sociodemographic profile, methods used to handle distress, motivation to participate in distance teaching, and challenges of distance teaching as well as the most worrisome issues during this pandemic. Three hundred eighty-two university teachers returned completed surveys. Results of K10 showed that 31.4% of respondents had severe distress and 38.2% had mild to moderate distress. Whereas gender was not associated with distress severity, age had a weak negative correlation (Rho = -0.19, P < 0.0001). Interestingly, most teachers had moderate to high motivation for distance teaching. Engagement with family was the most reported self-coping activity. More than half of the participants were most concerned and fearful about SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We used web scraping and API access to retrieve data from the news platform derstandard.at, Twitter, and a chat platform for students. We documented the technical details of our workflow to provide materials for other researchers interested in building a similar tool for different contexts. Automated text analysis allowed us to highlight changes of language use during COVID-19 in comparison to a neutral baseline. We used special word clouds to visualize that overall difference. Longitudinally, our time series showed spikes in anxiety that can be linked to several events and media reporting. Additionally, we found a marked decrease in anger. The changes lasted for remarkably long periods of time (up to 12 weeks). We have also discussed these and more patterns and connect them to the emergence of collective emotions.

An understanding of the key factors related to the therapist role and intervention delivery is required if these iCBTs are to be applied in routine clinical care and outcomes optimized. In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is greater emphasis on allowing patients access to remote therapies. We report the experiences and reflections of 4 therapists and their 2 supervisors in delivering an online, therapist-supported intervention in a randomized controlled trial for children and young people with tic disorders (the Online Remote Behavioural Intervention for Tics [ORBIT] trial). Themes discussed include the importance of training, supervision, creating support documents/manuals, and record keeping. Alongside this are communication strategies used by therapists to encourage patient adherence and treatment effectiveness. These include rapport building, treatment personalization, and suggestions for overcoming non-engagement. These reflections offer important considerations for the delivery of iCBTs as well as implications associated with the implementation of these interventions in existing services and future research studies.

Non-invasive strategies should first optimize body position with reverse Trendelenburg position or sitting position. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is considered as the first-line therapy in patients with obesity having a postoperative acute respiratory failure. Positive pressure pre-oxygenation before the intubation procedure is the method of reference. The use of videolaryngoscopy has to be considered by adequately trained intensivists, especially in patients with several risk factors. Regarding mechanical ventilation in patients with and without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), low tidal volume (6 ml/kg of predicted body weight) and moderate to high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), with careful recruitment maneuver in selected patients, are advised. Prone positioning is a therapeutic choice in severe ARDS patients with obesity. Prophylactic NIV should be considered after extubation to prevent re-intubation.

A few rare cases of neurological sequalae of SARS and MERS have been reported. A growing body of evidence is accumulating that COVID-19, particularly in severe cases, may have neurological consequences although respiratory symptoms nearly always develop prior to neurological ones. Patients with pre-existing neurological conditions may be at elevated risk for COVID-19-associated neurological symptoms.

We will discuss some trade-offs that arise from this perspective. We then suggest that public trust is of major importance for population uptake of contact tracing apps. Hasty, ill-prepared or badly communicated implementations of CT apps will likely undermine public trust, and as such, risk impeding general effectiveness.", "doi": "10.1007/s10676-020-09566-8", "pmid": "33106749", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "9566"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7577205"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-01T15:24:55.558Z", "modified": "2020-12-01T15:25:07.393Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "6be39116f72544b68d8d9dc7977d08a6", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/6be39116f72544b68d8d9dc7977d08a6.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/6be39116f72544b68d8d9dc7977d08a6"}}, "title": "International Sexual Health And REproductive health (I-SHARE) survey during COVID-19: study protocol for online national surveys and global comparative analyses.", "authors": [{"family": "Michielsen", "given": "Kristien", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Larrson", "given": "Elin C", "initials": "EC"}, {"family": "K\u00e5gesten", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Erausquin", "given": "Jennifer Toller", "initials": "JT"}, {"family": "Griffin", "given": "Sally", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Van de Velde", "given": "Sarah", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Tucker", "given": "Joseph D", "initials": "JD"}, {"family": "I-SHARE Team", "given": "", "initials": ""}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-10-20", "journal": {"title": "Sex Transm Infect", "issn": "1472-3263", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": "1368-4973"}, "abstract": "COVID-19 may have a profound impact on sexual health, reproductive health and social life across the world.

We estimated the ORs of distress by comparing trainees across programmes and training stages using multivariable logistic regression.\n\nSignificant psychological distress was found in 1150 (30.90%) participants and probable ASR in 403 (10.74%). Compared with the nursing trainees, the medical trainees (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.95) reported a higher burden of psychological distress during the outbreak, while the medical technology trainees (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.62) reported similar symptom scores.

The study was designed as a prospective, observational study where COVID-19 patients over 18 years admitted to hospital were eligible for inclusion.

Indeed, patients with asthma and allergy appear underrepresented in large reports of COVID-19 cases worldwide. In this review, we evaluate existing literature on this topic and potential underlying mechanisms for any interrelationship between asthma and COVID-19.\n\nData from several preclinical and clinical reports suggest a lower susceptibility for COVID-19 in patients with underlying type 2 airway inflammation including asthma that may be related to a reduced expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors for SARS-CoV-2. Corticosteroids further decrease expression of the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors, hence may also have a protective effect against infection with SARS-CoV-2. In addition, some studies suggest that the reported improvement in asthma control and a reduction in asthma exacerbations during the COVID-19 pandemic may be related to improvement in adherence to controller therapy and reduced exposure to triggers, such as other respiratory viruses and air pollutants. Recent data point towards differential susceptibility for COVID-19 among asthma patients based on their phenotype and/or endotype. On the basis of existing evidence, continuation with controller therapies is recommended for all patients with asthma. For patients with severe uncontrolled asthma infected by SARS-CoV-2, adjustment of controllers and biologics should be based on a multidisciplinary decision.\n\nUnderrepresentation of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with asthma and related allergic diseases may be based on potentially protective underlying mechanisms, such as type 2 airway inflammation, downregulation of ACE2/TMPRSS2 receptors, reduced exposures to triggers and improved adherence to controller medications.

The virus spread quickly, particularly in the North of Italy, with three regions (Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna) being the most severely affected. These three regions accounted for >80% of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases when the tight lockdown was established (March 8). These regions include one of Europe's areas of heaviest air pollution, the Po valley. Air pollution has been recently proposed as a possible risk factor of SARS-CoV-2 infection, due to its adverse effect on immunity and to the possibility that polluted air may even carry the virus. We investigated the association between air pollution and subsequent spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection within these regions. We collected NO 2 tropospheric levels using satellite data available at the European Space Agency before the lockdown. Using a multivariable restricted cubic spline regression model, we compared NO2 levels with SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence rate at different time points after the lockdown, namely March 8, 22 and April 5, in the 28 provinces of Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna. We found little association of NO2 levels with SARS-CoV-2 prevalence up to about 130 \u03bcmol/m2, while a positive association was evident at higher levels at each time point.

Method: During the 4 weeks immediately prior to and following the beginning of the German government's strategy for containment of Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 on March 23, 2020, 14 highly trained athletes (VO2peak: 3,162 \u00b1 774 ml/min; 500-m best time: 117.9 \u00b1 7.9 s) wore a multi-sensor smartwatch to allow continuous assessment of heart rate, physical activity, and sleep duration. Result: In comparison to before lockdown, the overall weekly training time and the average length of each session of training during the lockdown decreased by 27.6% (P = 0.02; d = 0.91) and 15.4% (P = 0.36; d = 0.36), respectively. At the same time, the number of sessions involving specific (i.e., canoeing and kayaking) and non-specific (i.e., running, cycling) training, respectively, did not change (P = 0.36-0.37; d = 0.34-0.35). The number of sessions involving strength (+17.4%; P = 0.03; d = 0.89) or other types of training (+16.7%; P = 0.06; d = 0.75) increased during the lockdown with 2.8-17.5% more training time involving a heart rate <60%, 82-88, 89-93, or 94-100% of individual peak heart rate (HRpeak) (P = 0.03-0.86; d = 0.07-1.38), and 4.3-18.7% less time with a heart rate of 60-72 or 73-83% HRpeak (P = < 0.001-0.0.26; d = 0.44-2.24). The daily duration of sleep was ~30 min (6.7%) longer during the lockdown (P < 0.001; d = 1.53) and the overall time spent lying down was 17% greater (P < 0.001; d = 2.26); whereas sitting time (-9.4%; P = 0.003; d = 1.23), the duration of light (15 min; -7.3%; P = 0.04; d = 0.83), and moderate (-18.6%; P = 0.01; d = 1.00) physical activity other than training (-9.4%; P = 0.22; d = 0.00) were all lower during lockdown. Conclusion: The present data revealed that following the German lockdown for containment of the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, highly trained kayakers and canoeists spent less overall time training each week (-27.6%) with, on average, shorter training sessions (-15.1%) and less light-to-moderate physical activity outside of training.

We have quantified the global impact by examining changes in the usage of online FRAX fracture risk assessments before and after the declaration of the pandemic (11 March 2020).\n\nThe study comprised a retrospective analysis using GoogleAnalytics data on daily sessions on the FRAX\u00ae website ( www.sheffield.ac.uk/FRAX ) from November 2019 to April 2020 (main analysis period February-April 2020), and the geographical source of that activity.\n\nOver February-April 2020, the FRAX website recorded 460,495 sessions from 184 countries, with 210,656 sessions in February alone. In March and April, the number of sessions fell by 23.1% and 58.3% respectively, a pattern not observed over the same period in 2019. There were smaller reductions in Asia than elsewhere, partly related to earlier and less-marked nadirs in some countries (China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Vietnam). In Europe, the majority of countries (24/31, 77.4%) reduced usage by at least 50% in April.

As a result, due to the destruction of nitric oxide ( \u2022NO) by inflammatory superoxide (O2\u2022-), pulmonary \u2022NO concentration ceases, resulting in uncontrolled platelet aggregation and massive thrombosis, which kills the patients. Introducing \u2022NO by inhalation (INO) may replace the loss of endothelium-derived \u2022NO. The first results from clinical trials with INO in SARS-CoV-2 patients show a rapid and sustained improvement in cardiopulmonary function and decreased inflammation. An ongoing phase III study is expected to confirm the method's efficacy. INO may hence become a first line treatment in SARS-CoV-2 patients. However, due to the rapid inactivation of \u2022NO by deoxyhemoglobin to nitrate, pulmonary administration of \u2022NO will not protect remote organs. Another INO-related pharmacological approach to protect SARS-CoV-2 patients from developing life-threatening disease is to inhibit the O2\u2022--driven destruction of \u2022NO by neutralizing inflammatory O2\u2022-. By making use of low molecular weight compounds that mimic the action of the enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). The MnSOD mimetics of the so-called porphyrin type (e.g., AEOL 10150), salen type (e.g., EUK-8) and cyclic polyamine type (e.g., M40419, today known as GC4419 and avasopasem manganese) have all been shown to positively affect the inflammatory response in lung epithelial cells in preclinical models of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The Manganese diPyridoxyL EthylDiamine (MnPLED)-type mangafodipir (manganese dipyridoxyl diphosphate-MnDPDP), a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent that possesses MnSOD mimetic activity, has shown promising results in various forms of inflammation, in preclinical as well as clinical settings. Intravenously administration of mangafodipir will, in contrast to INO, reach remote organs and may hence become an important supplement to INO. From the authors' viewpoint, it appears logical to test mangafodipr in COVID-19 patients at risk of developing life-threatening SARS-CoV-2. Five days after submission of the current manuscript, Galera Pharmaceuticals Inc. announced the dosing of the first patient in a randomized, double-blind pilot phase II clinical trial with GC4419 for COVID-19.

evidence of a link between COVID-19 and chemosensory impairments, such as anosmia. However, these reports have downplayed or failed to distinguish potential effects on taste, ignored chemesthesis, and generally lacked quantitative measurements. Here, we report the development, implementation, and initial results of a multilingual, international questionnaire to assess self-reported quantity and quality of perception in 3 distinct chemosensory modalities (smell, taste, and chemesthesis) before and during COVID-19. In the first 11 days after questionnaire launch, 4039 participants (2913 women, 1118 men, and 8 others, aged 19-79) reported a COVID-19 diagnosis either via laboratory tests or clinical assessment. Importantly, smell, taste, and chemesthetic function were each significantly reduced compared to their status before the disease. Difference scores (maximum possible change \u00b1100) revealed a mean reduction of smell (-79.7 \u00b1 28.7, mean \u00b1 standard deviation), taste (-69.0 \u00b1 32.6), and chemesthetic (-37.3 \u00b1 36.2) function during COVID-19. Qualitative changes in olfactory ability (parosmia and phantosmia) were relatively rare and correlated with smell loss. Importantly, perceived nasal obstruction did not account for smell loss. Furthermore, chemosensory impairments were similar between participants in the laboratory test and clinical assessment groups. These results show that COVID-19-associated chemosensory impairment is not limited to smell but also affects taste and chemesthesis. The multimodal impact of COVID-19 and the lack of perceived nasal obstruction suggest that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus strain 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may disrupt sensory-neural mechanisms.", "doi": "10.1093/chemse/bjaa041", "pmid": "32564071", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "5860460"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7337664"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-08T16:36:10.943Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:46:13.465Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "b0f0deb544914e6da3b55eb7fa321c80", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/b0f0deb544914e6da3b55eb7fa321c80.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/b0f0deb544914e6da3b55eb7fa321c80"}}, "title": "Beyond COVID-19-a paradigm shift in infection management?", "authors": [{"family": "Vehreschild", "given": "Maria J G T", "initials": "MJGT"}, {"family": "Tacconelli", "given": "Evelina", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Giske", "given": "Christian G", "initials": "CG"}, {"family": "Peschel", "given": "Andreas", "initials": "A"}], "type": "letter", "published": "2020-10-09", "journal": {"title": "Lancet Infect Dis", "issn": "1474-4457", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30789-1", "pmid": "33045187", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S1473-3099(20)30789-1"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7546645"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-01T17:16:03.841Z", "modified": "2020-12-01T17:16:03.868Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "4f2ba3380aa140688274e008ceb51960", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/4f2ba3380aa140688274e008ceb51960.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/4f2ba3380aa140688274e008ceb51960"}}, "title": "A population-based cohort study of socio-demographic risk factors for COVID-19 deaths in Sweden.", "authors": [{"family": "Drefahl", "given": "Sven", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Wallace", "given": "Matthew", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Mussino", "given": "Eleonora", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Aradhya", "given": "Siddartha", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Kolk", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Brand\u00e9n", "given": "Maria", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Malmberg", "given": "Bo", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "Gunnar", "initials": "G"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-10-09", "journal": {"title": "Nat Commun", "issn": "2041-1723", "volume": "11", "issue": "1", "pages": "5097", "issn-l": "2041-1723"}, "abstract": "As global deaths from COVID-19 continue to rise, the world's governments, institutions, and agencies are still working toward an understanding of who is most at risk of death.

Hence there is a marked knowledge gap that requires urgent attention. Therefore, in this systematic review, viability/stability of airborne SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses is discussed.\n\nA systematic literature review was performed on PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science and Scopus to assess the stability and viability of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 on air samples.\n\nThe initial search identified 27 articles. Following screening of titles and abstracts and removing duplicates, 11 articles were considered relevant. Temperatures ranging from 20 \u00b0C to 25 \u00b0C and relative humidity ranging from 40% to 50% were reported to have a protective effect on viral viability for airborne SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. As no data is yet available on the conditions influencing viability for airborne SARS-CoV-2, and given the genetic similarity to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, one could extrapolate that the same conditions would apply. Nonetheless, the effect of these conditions seems to be residual considering the increasing number of cases in the south of USA, Brazil and India, where high temperatures and humidities have been observed.\n\nHigher temperatures and high relative humidity can have a modest effect on SARS-CoV-2 viability in the environment, as reported in previous studies to this date. However, these studies are experimental, and do not support the fact that the virus has efficiently spread in the tropical regions of the globe, with other transmission routes such as the contact and droplet ones probably being responsible for the majority of cases reported in these regions, along with other factors such as human mobility patterns and contact rates. Further studies are needed to investigate the extent of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as this would have important implications for public health and infection-control policies.", "doi": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142802", "pmid": "33071145", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0048-9697(20)36331-2"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7543729"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-27T11:51:35.091Z", "modified": "2020-12-01T17:05:19.632Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "7c590b4e9a234f918c74726c082da341", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7c590b4e9a234f918c74726c082da341.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7c590b4e9a234f918c74726c082da341"}}, "title": "Living with the COVID-19 pandemic: act now with the tools we have.", "authors": [{"family": "Bedford", "given": "Juliet", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Enria", "given": "Delia", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Giesecke", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Heymann", "given": "David L", "initials": "DL"}, {"family": "Ihekweazu", "given": "Chikwe", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Kobinger", "given": "Gary", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Lane", "given": "H Clifford", "initials": "HC"}, {"family": "Memish", "given": "Ziad A", "initials": "ZA"}, {"family": "Oh", "given": "Myoung-Don", "initials": "MD"}, {"family": "Sall", "given": "Amadou Alpha", "initials": "AA"}, {"family": "Ungchusak", "given": "Kumnuan", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Wieler", "given": "Lothar H", "initials": "LH"}, {"family": "WHO Strategic and Technical Advisory Group for Infectious Hazards", "given": "", "initials": ""}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-10-08", "journal": {"title": "Lancet", "issn": "1474-547X", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": "0140-6736"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32117-6", "pmid": "33038947", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0140-6736(20)32117-6"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7544497"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-01T17:21:13.505Z", "modified": "2020-12-01T17:21:13.515Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "6b71d3289aed493a916aaaca1fbb2ea6", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/6b71d3289aed493a916aaaca1fbb2ea6.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/6b71d3289aed493a916aaaca1fbb2ea6"}}, "title": "What every Researcher should know about Searching - Clarified Concepts, Search Advice, and an Agenda to improve Finding in Academia.", "authors": [{"family": "Gusenbauer", "given": "Michael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Haddaway", "given": "Neal R", "initials": "NR"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-10-08", "journal": {"title": "Res Synth Methods", "issn": "1759-2887", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "We researchers have taken searching for information for granted for far too long.

This COVID-19 information crisis is indicative of the broader problem of information overloaded academic research. To improve our finding capabilities, we urgently need to improve how we search and the systems we use. We respond to Klopfenstein and Dampier (Res Syn Meth. 2020) who commented on our 2020 paper and proposed a way of improving PubMed's and Google Scholar's search functionalities. Our response puts their commentary in a larger frame and suggests how we can improve academic searching altogether. We urge that researchers need to understand that search skills require dedicated education and training. Better and more efficient searching requires an initial understanding of the different goals that define the way searching needs to be conducted. We explain the main types of searching that we academics routinely engage in; distinguishing lookup, exploratory, and systematic searching. These three types must be conducted using different search methods (heuristics) and using search systems with specific capabilities. To improve academic searching, we introduce the \"Search Triangle\" model emphasizing the importance of matching goals, heuristics, and systems. Further, we suggest an urgently needed agenda toward search literacy as the norm in academic research and fit-for-purpose search systems.", "doi": "10.1002/jrsm.1457", "pmid": "33031639", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-01T17:31:05.757Z", "modified": "2020-12-01T17:31:05.783Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "64e939415762403c9009f86ec14f76ef", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/64e939415762403c9009f86ec14f76ef.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/64e939415762403c9009f86ec14f76ef"}}, "title": "Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in COVID-19-related encephalopathy.", "authors": [{"family": "Muccioli", "given": "Lorenzo", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Pensato", "given": "Umberto", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Bernab\u00e8", "given": "Giorgia", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Ferri", "given": "Lorenzo", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Tappat\u00e0", "given": "Maria", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Volpi", "given": "Lilia", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Cani", "given": "Ilaria", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Henry", "given": "Olivia J", "initials": "OJ"}, {"family": "Ceccaroni", "given": "Francesca", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Cevoli", "given": "Sabina", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Stofella", "given": "Gloria", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Pasini", "given": "Elena", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Fornaro", "given": "Giacomo", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Tonon", "given": "Caterina", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Vidale", "given": "Simone", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Liguori", "given": "Rocco", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Tinuper", "given": "Paolo", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Michelucci", "given": "Roberto", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Cortelli", "given": "Pietro", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Bisulli", "given": "Francesca", "initials": "F"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-10-08", "journal": {"title": "J Neurol", "issn": "1432-1459", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "To report on efficacy and safety of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy in a case series of patients with COVID-19-related encephalopathy.\n\nWe retrospectively collected data on all patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at two Italian hospitals who developed encephalopathy during disease course and were treated with IVIg.\n\nFive patients (two females, mean age 66.8 years) developed encephalopathy after a mean of 12.6 days, since the onset of respiratory/constitutional symptoms related to COVID-19.

COVID-19 patients have been majority male in the US and Spain, but predominantly female in South Korea. Age profiles vary across data sources. Compared to 84,585 individuals hospitalised with influenza in 2014-19, COVID-19 patients have more typically been male, younger, and with fewer comorbidities and lower medication use.

We aimed to describe the worldwide COVID-19 clinical research response and its evolution over the first 100 days of the pandemic. Methods: Descriptive analysis of planned, ongoing or completed trials by April 9, 2020 testing any intervention to treat or prevent COVID-19, systematically identified in trial registries, preprint servers, and literature databases. A survey was conducted of all trials to assess their recruitment status up to July 6, 2020. Results: Most of the 689 trials (overall target sample size 396,366) were small (median sample size 120; interquartile range [IQR] 60-300) but randomized (75.8%; n=522) and were often conducted in China (51.1%; n=352) or the USA (11%; n=76). 525 trials (76.2%) planned to include 155,571 hospitalized patients, and 25 (3.6%) planned to include 96,821 health-care workers. Treatments were evaluated in 607 trials (88.1%), frequently antivirals (n=144) or antimalarials (n=112); 78 trials (11.3%) focused on prevention, including 14 vaccine trials. No trial investigated social distancing. Interventions tested in 11 trials with >5,000 participants were also tested in 169 smaller trials (median sample size 273; IQR 90-700). Hydroxychloroquine alone was investigated in 110 trials. While 414 trials (60.0%) expected completion in 2020, only 35 trials (4.1%; 3,071 participants) were completed by July 6. Of 112 trials with detailed recruitment information, 55 had recruited <20% of the targeted sample; 27 between 20-50%; and 30 over 50% (median 14.8% [IQR 2.0-62.0%]). Conclusions: The size and speed of the COVID-19 clinical trials agenda is unprecedented. However, most trials were small investigating a small fraction of treatment options. The feasibility of this research agenda is questionable, and many trials may end in futility, wasting research resources. Much better coordination is needed to respond to global health threats.", "doi": "10.12688/f1000research.26707.2", "pmid": "33082937", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7539080.2"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-19T19:33:08.731Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:46:13.283Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "ea5eacb93e4747ee98374542036f42a9", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/ea5eacb93e4747ee98374542036f42a9.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/ea5eacb93e4747ee98374542036f42a9"}}, "title": "Nitric oxide dosed in short bursts at high concentrations may protect against Covid 19.", "authors": [{"family": "Hedenstierna", "given": "G\u00f6ran", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Chen", "given": "Luni", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Hedenstierna", "given": "Magnus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Lieberman", "given": "Robert", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Fine", "given": "David H", "initials": "DH"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-10-01", "journal": {"title": "Nitric Oxide", "issn": "1089-8611", "volume": "103", "issue": null, "pages": "1-3", "issn-l": "1089-8603"}, "abstract": "It has long been suggested that NO may inhibit an early stage in viral replication. Furthermore, in vitro tests have shown that NO inhibits the replication cycle of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Despite smoking being listed as a risk factor to contract Covid-19, only a low proportion of the smokers suffered from SARS-corona infection in China 2003, and from Covid-19 in China, Europe and the US. We hypothesize, that the intermittent bursts of high NO concentration in cigarette smoke may be a mechanism in protecting against the virus. Mainstream smoke from cigarettes contains NO at peak concentrations of between about 250 ppm and 1350 ppm in each puff as compared to medicinal use of no more than 80 to a maximum of 160 ppm. The diffusion of NO through the cell wall to reach the virus should be significantly more effective at the very high NO concentration in the smoke, according to classic laws of physics. The only oxide of nitrogen in the mainstream smoke is NO, and the NO 2 concentration that is inhaled is very low or undetectable, and methemoglobin levels are lower in smokers than non-smokers, reasonably explained by the breaths of air in between the puffs that wash out the NO. Specialized iNO machines can now be developed to provide the drug intermittently in short bursts at high concentration dose, which would then provide both a preventative drug for those at high risk, as well as an effective treatment, without the health hazards associated with smoking.", "doi": "10.1016/j.niox.2020.06.005", "pmid": "32590117", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S1089-8603(20)30161-0"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-18T17:31:13.966Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:46:13.570Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "e6a43c1c7bad40cc931b0b4b61b9ae1a", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/e6a43c1c7bad40cc931b0b4b61b9ae1a.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/e6a43c1c7bad40cc931b0b4b61b9ae1a"}}, "title": "In search of the relevant COVID research.", "authors": [{"family": "Allebeck", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "S\u00f6rberg Wallin", "given": "Alma", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-10-01", "journal": {"title": "Eur J Public Health", "issn": "1464-360X", "volume": "30", "issue": "5", "pages": "850-851", "issn-l": "1101-1262"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1093/eurpub/ckaa169", "pmid": "32818271", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "5894973"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7536247"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-07T12:24:48.738Z", "modified": "2020-12-07T12:25:07.393Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "c8d295439f1242699d9db621b035dca5", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/c8d295439f1242699d9db621b035dca5.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/c8d295439f1242699d9db621b035dca5"}}, "title": "Coping behaviors associated with decreased anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown.", "authors": [{"family": "Fullana", "given": "Miquel A", "initials": "MA"}, {"family": "Hidalgo-Mazzei", "given": "Diego", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Vieta", "given": "Eduard", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Radua", "given": "Joaquim", "initials": "J"}], "type": "letter", "published": "2020-10-01", "journal": {"title": "J Affect Disord", "issn": "1573-2517", "volume": "275", "issue": null, "pages": "80-81", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown might increase anxiety and depressive symptoms, but some behaviors may protect against them.\n\nTo provide a preliminary evidence of the behaviors associated with decreased symptoms in the current COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, we conducted a survey of 5545 adult individuals from the Spanish general population, two weeks after an official lockdown was established across the country.\n\nSixty-five percent of the sample reported anxiety or depressive symptoms.

Our objective was to outline the current situation regarding EEG-based investigations across Europe. A web-based survey was distributed to centres within the European Reference Network on rare and complex epilepsies (ERN EpiCARE). Responses were collected between April 9 and May 15, 2020. Results were analysed with Microsoft Excel, Python Pandas and SciPy. Representants from 47 EpiCARE centres from 22 countries completed the survey. At the time of completing the survey, inpatient video-EEGs had been stopped or restricted in most centres (61.7% vs. 36.2% for adults, and 38.3% vs. 53.2% for children). Invasive investigations and epilepsy surgery were similarly affected. Acute EEGs continued to be performed, while indications for outpatient EEGs were limited and COVID-19 triage put in place. The strictness of measures varied according to extent of the outbreak in a given country.

The use of cloth masks for general public use is being debated, and is in flux. We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and Google for articles reporting the filtration properties of flat cloth or cloth masks. We reviewed the reference lists of relevant articles to identify further articles and identified articles through social and conventional news media. We found 25 articles. Study of protection for the wearer used healthy volunteers, or used a manikin wearing a mask, with airflow to simulate different breathing rates. Studies of protection of the environment, also known as source control, used convenience samples of healthy volunteers. The design and execution of the studies was generally rigorously described. Many descriptions of cloth lacked the detail required for reproducibility; no study provided all the expected details of material, thread count, weave, and weight. Some of the homemade mask designs were reproducible. Successful masks were made of muslin at 100 threads per inch (TPI) in 3 to 4 layers (4-layer muslin or a muslin-flannel-muslin sandwich), tea towels (also known as dish towels), made using 1 layer (2 layers would be expected to be better), and good-quality cotton T-shirts in 2 layers (with a stitched edge to prevent stretching). In flat-cloth experiments, linen tea towels, 600-TPI cotton in 2 layers, and 600-TPI cotton with 90-TPI flannel performed well but 80-TPI cotton in 2 layers did not. We therefore recommend cotton or flannel at least 100 TPI, at least 2 layers. More layers, 3 or 4, will provide increased filtration but there is a trade-off in that more layers increases the resistance to breathing. Although this is not a systematic review, we included all the articles that we identified in an unbiased way. We did not include gray literature or preprints.

In non-coronavirus cohorts, evidence has accumulated of an interaction between the complement and coagulation systems, with one amplifying activation of the other. A pressing question is therefore if COVID-19 associated thrombosis could be caused by overactivation of the complement cascade? In this review, we summarize the literature on thrombotic complications in COVID-19, complement activation in coronavirus infections, and the crosstalk between the complement and coagulation systems. We demonstrate how the complement system is able to activate the coagulation cascade and platelets, inhibit fibrinolysis and stimulate endothelial cells. We also describe how these interactions see clinical relevance in several disorders where overactive complement results in a prothrombotic clinical presentation, and how it could be clinically relevant in COVID-19.", "doi": "10.1016/j.thromres.2020.06.027", "pmid": "32569879", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0049-3848(20)30269-3"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7301826"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-26T12:14:19.289Z", "modified": "2020-11-30T08:59:18.013Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "b15ba4b711654135a2ba50602ff79c98", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/b15ba4b711654135a2ba50602ff79c98.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/b15ba4b711654135a2ba50602ff79c98"}}, "title": "EXPOSED: An occupant exposure model for confined spaces to retrofit crowd models during a pandemic.", "authors": [{"family": "Ronchi", "given": "Enrico", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Lovreglio", "given": "Ruggiero", "initials": "R"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-10-00", "journal": {"title": "Saf Sci", "issn": "0925-7535", "volume": "130", "issue": null, "pages": "104834", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Crowd models can be used for the simulation of people movement in the built environment.

The proposed model allows the investigation of occupant exposure in buildings based on the analysis of microscopic people movement.

In particular, the face and body protective equipment is critical to prevent the wearer from exposure to pathogenic biological airborne particulates. This situation has been now observed worldwide during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As concern over shortages of PPE at hospitals grows, we share with the public and makers' community the Pressure Optimized PowEred Respirator (PROPER) equipment, made out of COTS components. It is functionally equivalent to a Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR). PROPER, a hood-based system which uses open source and easily accessible components is low-cost, relatively passive in terms of energy consumption and mechanisms, and easy and fast to 3D print, build and assemble. We have adapted our experience on building clean room environments and qualifying the bioburden of space instruments to this solution, which is in essence a miniaturized, personal, wearable cleanroom. PROPER would be able to offer better protection than an N95 respirator mask, mainly because it is insensitive to seal fit and it shields the eyes as well. The PROPER SMS fabric is designed for single-use and not intended for reuse, as they may start to tear and fail but the rest of the parts can be disinfected and reused. We provide a set of guidelines to build a low-cost 3D printed solution for an effective PAPR system and describe the procedures to validate it to comply with the biosafety level 3 requirements. We have validated the prototype of PROPER unit for air flow, ISO class cleanliness level, oxygen and carbon-dioxide gas concentrations during exhalation, and present here these results for illustration. We demonstrate that the area inside the hood is more than 200 times cleaner than the external ambient without the operator and more than 175 times with the operator and in an aerosol exposed environment. We also include the procedure to clean and disinfect the equipment for reuse.

This disease, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has developed into a pandemic. To date, it has resulted in ~9 million confirmed cases and caused almost 500 000 related deaths worldwide. Unequivocally, the COVID-19 pandemic is the gravest health and socioeconomic crisis of our time. In this context, numerous questions have emerged in demand of basic scientific information and evidence-based medical advice on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. Although the majority of the patients show a very mild, self-limiting viral respiratory disease, many clinical manifestations in severe patients are unique to COVID-19, such as severe lymphopenia and eosinopenia, extensive pneumonia, a \"cytokine storm\" leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome, endothelitis, thromboembolic complications, and multiorgan failure. The epidemiologic features of COVID-19 are distinctive and have changed throughout the pandemic. Vaccine and drug development studies and clinical trials are rapidly growing at an unprecedented speed. However, basic and clinical research on COVID-19-related topics should be based on more coordinated high-quality studies. This paper answers pressing questions, formulated by young clinicians and scientists, on SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, and allergy, focusing on the following topics: virology, immunology, diagnosis, management of patients with allergic disease and asthma, treatment, clinical trials, drug discovery, vaccine development, and epidemiology. A total of 150 questions were answered by experts in the field providing a comprehensive and practical overview of COVID-19 and allergic disease.", "doi": "10.1111/all.14449", "pmid": "32535955", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7323196"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-30T09:00:22.912Z", "modified": "2020-11-30T09:00:22.921Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "96b0715e8c8b4184a63d7666de8d709d", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/96b0715e8c8b4184a63d7666de8d709d.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/96b0715e8c8b4184a63d7666de8d709d"}}, "title": "Paediatric COVID-19 admissions in a region with open schools during the two first months of the pandemic.", "authors": [{"family": "Hildenwall", "given": "Helena", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Luthander", "given": "Joachim", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Rhedin", "given": "Samuel", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Hertting", "given": "Olof", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Olsson-\u00c5kefeldt", "given": "Selma", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Mel\u00e9n", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Alfv\u00e9n", "given": "Tobias", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Herlenius", "given": "Eric", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Ryd Rinder", "given": "Malin", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-10-00", "journal": {"title": "Acta Paediatr", "issn": "1651-2227", "volume": "109", "issue": "10", "pages": "2152-2154", "issn-l": "0803-5253"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1111/apa.15432", "pmid": "32567145", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7323214"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-08T16:30:28.877Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:45:48.478Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "8da6e2c62015459089ced85518bfb9cb", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/8da6e2c62015459089ced85518bfb9cb.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/8da6e2c62015459089ced85518bfb9cb"}}, "title": "Education for sustainable healthcare: Leadership to get from here to there.", "authors": [{"family": "McKimm", "given": "Judy", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Redvers", "given": "Nicole", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "El Omrani", "given": "Omnia", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Parkes", "given": "Margot W", "initials": "MW"}, {"family": "Elf", "given": "Marie", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Woollard", "given": "Robert", "initials": "R"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-10-00", "journal": {"title": "Med Teach", "issn": "1466-187X", "volume": "42", "issue": "10", "pages": "1123-1127", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "The current global crises, including climate, COVID-19, and environmental change, requires global collective action at all scales.

The aim of this consensus-based document is to describe the effects of viral infections resulting in epidemics and pandemics that affect the lung (MERS, SARS, HIV, influenza A (H1N1)pdm/09 and COVID-19) and their interactions with TB. A search of the scientific literature was performed. A writing committee of international experts including the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control Public Health Emergency (ECDC PHE) team, the World Association for Infectious Diseases and Immunological Disorders (WAidid), the Global Tuberculosis Network (GTN), and members of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) Study Group for Mycobacterial Infections (ESGMYC) was established. Consensus was achieved after multiple rounds of revisions between the writing committee and a larger expert group. A Delphi process involving the core group of authors (excluding the ECDC PHE team) identified the areas requiring review/consensus, followed by a second round to refine the definitive consensus elements. The epidemiology and immunology of these viral infections and their interactions with TB are discussed with implications for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of airborne infections (infection control, viral containment and workplace safety).

Seven electronic databases were searched to April 6, 2020, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or nonrandomized prospective studies in the field. Study selection, data extraction, and risk-of-bias assessment were performed for all included studies, while the outcome of interest pertained to differences in bacterial load quantification through the use of different interventions prior to aerosol-generating procedures in dental practices. Random effects frequentist network meta-analysis was performed, with mean difference (MD) and 95% CI as the effect measure. Confidence in the documented evidence was assessed through the newly fueled CINeMA framework (Confidence in Network Meta-analysis) based on the GRADE approach (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Twenty-nine clinical trials were deemed eligible, 21 RCTs and 8 nonrandomized studies, while 11 RCTs contributed to the network meta-analysis, comprising 10 competing interventions. Tempered chlorhexidine (CHX) 0.2% as compared with nonactive control mouth rinse, prior to routine ultrasonic scaling, was most effective toward reduced postprocedural bacterial load with an MD of -0.92 (95% CI, -1.54 to -0.29) in log 10 bacterial CFUs (colony-forming units). For CHX 0.2%, an MD of -0.74 (95% CI, -1.07 to -0.40) was observed as compared with control. Tempered CHX 0.2% presented the highest probabilities of being ranked the most effective treatment (31.2%). Level of confidence varied from very low to moderate across all formulated comparisons. These findings summarize the current state of research evidence in the field of aerosolized bacteria in dentistry.

Which lessons can we learn? We identified relevant publications (until 26 July 2020) using systematic searches in PubMed, Web of Science, and Ovid EMBASE with predefined search strings. A total of 4571 unique publications were retrieved, out of which 378 publications were selected for in-depth analysis by two raters, including a total of 17549 (out of which were 14418 SARS-CoV-2) patients. Neurological complications and associated neuroradiological manifestations are prevalent for all HCoVs (HCoV-229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2). Moreover there are similarities in symptomatology across different HCoVs, particularly between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Common neurological manifestations include fatigue, headache, and smell/taste disorders. Additionally, clinicians need to be attentive for at least five classes of neurological complications: (1) Cerebrovascular disorders including ischemic stroke and macro/micro-hemorrhages, (2) encephalopathies, (3) para-/postinfectious immune-mediated complications such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, (4) (meningo-)encephalitis, potentially with concomitant seizures, and (5) neuropsychiatric complications such as psychosis and mood disorders. Our systematic review highlights the need for vigilance regarding neurological complications in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 and other HCoVs, especially since some complications may result in chronic disability. Neuroimaging protocols should be designed to specifically screen for these complications. Therefore, we propose practical imaging guidelines to facilitate the diagnostic workup and monitoring of patients infected with HCoVs.", "doi": "10.1002/acn3.51166", "pmid": "32853453", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7461163"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-26T12:17:30.281Z", "modified": "2020-11-30T08:36:35.331Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "57349b4780174ff1a804f9c0301aee0d", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/57349b4780174ff1a804f9c0301aee0d.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/57349b4780174ff1a804f9c0301aee0d"}}, "title": "The mediating effect of the cyberchondria and anxiety sensitivity in the association between problematic internet use, metacognition beliefs, and fear of COVID-19 among Iranian online population.", "authors": [{"family": "Seyed Hashemi", "given": "Seyed Ghasem", "initials": "SG"}, {"family": "Hosseinnezhad", "given": "Shalaleh", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Dini", "given": "Solmaz", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Griffiths", "given": "Mark D", "initials": "MD"}, {"family": "Lin", "given": "Chung-Ying", "initials": "CY"}, {"family": "Pakpour", "given": "Amir H", "initials": "AH"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-10-00", "journal": {"title": "Heliyon", "issn": "2405-8440", "volume": "6", "issue": "10", "pages": "e05135", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "With the rapid growth of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), individuals may try to find related medical information using the internet to overcome their fears. Under such circumstances, individuals with the features of cyberchondria, anxiety sensitivity, and metacognitive beliefs in negative thoughts may suffer more fears than those without these features. Therefore, the present study proposed a model to understand the associations between problematic internet use (PIU), cyberchondria, anxiety sensitivity, metacognition beliefs, and fear of COVID-19. Utilizing a cross-sectional online survey, 651 Iranians completed the following psychometric scales: Metacognition Questionnaire-30 (MCQ-30), Anxiety Sensitivity Questionnaire (ASI), Cyberchondria Severity Scale-Short Form (CSS-12), Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), and Generalized Problematic Internet Use Scale (GPIUS). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to assess the proposed model via several fit indices. The indices include Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), comparative fit index (CFI), standardized root mean square residual (SRMR), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). The fit indices (CFI = 0.948, TLI = 0.938, RMSEA = 0.053, and SRMR = 0.001) indicated the good fit between the data and the proposed model. Moreover, fear of COVID-19 was significantly and directly predicted by cyberchondria (\u03b2 = 0.479, p < .001) and anxiety sensitivity (\u03b2 = 0.286, p < .001). The relationship between PIU and cyberchondria with fear of COVID-19 was mediated significantly by anxiety sensitivity and metacognitive beliefs. Because fear of COVID-19 was found to be significantly associated with cyberchondria and anxiety sensitivity, healthcare providers may want to provide additional support for those with cyberchondria and anxiety sensitivity tendencies.", "doi": "10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05135", "pmid": "33072911", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S2405-8440(20)31978-2"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7547399"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-01T17:02:50.671Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:46:13.126Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "5631ba3e9abe4a2c85c782382fa3aa01", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/5631ba3e9abe4a2c85c782382fa3aa01.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/5631ba3e9abe4a2c85c782382fa3aa01"}}, "title": "COVID-19 and the brain: impact on nuclear medicine in neurology.", "authors": [{"family": "Morbelli", "given": "Silvia", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Ekmekcioglu", "given": "Ozgul", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Barthel", "given": "Henryk", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Albert", "given": "Nathalie L", "initials": "NL"}, {"family": "Boellaard", "given": "Ronald", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Cecchin", "given": "Diego", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Guedj", "given": "Eric", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Lammertsma", "given": "Adriaan A", "initials": "AA"}, {"family": "Law", "given": "Ian", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Penuelas", "given": "Ivan", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Semah", "given": "Franck", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Traub-Weidinger", "given": "Tatjana", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "van de Giessen", "given": "Elsmarieke", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Varrone", "given": "Andrea", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Garibotto", "given": "Valentina", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "EANM Neuroimaging Committee", "given": "", "initials": ""}], "type": "editorial", "published": "2020-10-00", "journal": {"title": "Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging", "issn": "1619-7089", "volume": "47", "issue": "11", "pages": "2487-2492", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1007/s00259-020-04965-x", "pmid": "32700058", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1007/s00259-020-04965-x"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7375837"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-07T16:22:42.972Z", "modified": "2020-12-07T16:22:42.994Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "53e0c79e38674500b109629509265e6e", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/53e0c79e38674500b109629509265e6e.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/53e0c79e38674500b109629509265e6e"}}, "title": "The impact of COVID-19 on research.", "authors": [{"family": "Harper", "given": "L", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Kalfa", "given": "N", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Beckers", "given": "G M A", "initials": "GMA"}, {"family": "Kaefer", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Nieuwhof-Leppink", "given": "A J", "initials": "AJ"}, {"family": "Fossum", "given": "Magdalena", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Herbst", "given": "K W", "initials": "KW"}, {"family": "Bagli", "given": "D", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "ESPU Research Committee", "given": "", "initials": ""}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-10-00", "journal": {"title": "J Pediatr Urol", "issn": "1873-4898", "volume": "16", "issue": "5", "pages": "715-716", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jpurol.2020.07.002", "pmid": "32713792", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S1477-5131(20)30412-5"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7343645"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-07T16:13:37.865Z", "modified": "2020-12-07T16:13:37.891Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "4e6914020d7d475d935aa1ca7e8a49e7", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/4e6914020d7d475d935aa1ca7e8a49e7.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/4e6914020d7d475d935aa1ca7e8a49e7"}}, "title": "Existing highly accumulating lysosomotropic drugs with potential for repurposing to target COVID-19.", "authors": [{"family": "Norinder", "given": "Ulf", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Tuck", "given": "Astrud", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Norgren", "given": "Kalle", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Munic Kos", "given": "Vesna", "initials": "V"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-10-00", "journal": {"title": "Biomed Pharmacother", "issn": "1950-6007", "volume": "130", "issue": null, "pages": "110582", "issn-l": "0753-3322"}, "abstract": "Given the speed of viral infection spread, repurposing of existing drugs has been given the highest priority in combating the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Only drugs that are already registered or close to registration, and therefore have passed lengthy safety assessments, have a chance to be tested in clinical trials and reach patients quickly enough to help in the current disease outbreak. Here, we have reviewed available evidence and possible ways forward to identify already existing pharmaceuticals displaying modest broad-spectrum antiviral activity which is likely linked to their high accumulation in cells. Several well studied examples indicate that these drugs accumulate in lysosomes, endosomes and biological membranes in general, and thereby interfere with endosomal pathway and intracellular membrane trafficking crucial for viral infection. With the aim to identify other lysosomotropic drugs with possible inherent antiviral activity, we have applied a set of clear physicochemical, pharmacokinetic and molecular criteria on 530 existing drugs. In addition to publicly available data, we have also used our in silico model for the prediction of accumulation in lysosomes and endosomes. By this approach we have identified 36 compounds with possible antiviral effects, also against coronaviruses. For 14 of them evidence of broad-spectrum antiviral activity has already been reported, adding support to the value of this approach.

We conducted analyses by docking the compounds against two SARS-CoV-2-specific targets: (1) the receptor binding domain spike protein and (2) the main protease of the virus (MPro) using the Schr\u00f6dinger software. Importantly, the docking analysis revealed that doxycycline (DOX) showed the most effective binding to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, whereas halofantrine and mefloquine bound effectively with the main protease among the antimalarial drugs evaluated in the present study. The in silico approach reported here suggested that DOX could potentially be a good candidate for repurposing for COVID-19. In contrast, to decipher the actual potential of DOX and halofantrine against COVID-19, further in vitro and in vivo studies are called for.

COVID-19 hits greatly the elder and more fragile fraction of the population boosting the evergreen issue of the vaccination of older people. The development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 tailored for the elderly population faces the challenge of the poor immune responsiveness of the older population due to immunosenescence, comorbidities, and pharmacological treatments. Moreover, it is likely that the inflammaging phenotype associated with age could both influence vaccination efficacy and exacerbate the risk of COVID-19-related \"cytokine storm syndrome\" with an overlap between the factors which impact vaccination effectiveness and those that boost virulence and worsen the prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The complex and still unclear immunopathological mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, together with the progressive age-related decline of immune responses, and the lack of clear correlates of protection, make the design of vaccination strategies for older people extremely challenging. In the ongoing effort in vaccine development, different SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates have been developed, tested in pre-clinical and clinical studies and are undergoing clinical testing, but only a small fraction of these are currently being tested in the older fraction of the population.

While there is evidence indicating that suicide rates de-crease during times of crises, they are expected to increase once the immediate crisis has passed.

Economic downturn, augmented barriers to accessing health care, increased access to suicidal means, inappropriate media reporting at the societal level; deprioritization of mental health and preventive activities at the community level; interpersonal conflicts, neglect and violence at the relationship level; unemployment, poverty, loneliness and hopelessness at the individual level: all these variables contribute to an increase of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, harmful use of alcohol, substance abuse, and ultimately suicide risk. Suicide should be prevented by strengthening universal strategies directed to the entire population, including mitigation of unemployment, poverty and inequalities; prioritization of access to mental health care; responsible media reporting, with information about available support; prevention of increased alcohol intake; and restriction of access to lethal means of suicide. Selective interventions should continue to target known vulnerable groups who are socio-economically disadvantaged, but also new ones such as first responders and health care staff, and the bereaved by COVID-19 who have been deprived of the final contact with loved ones and funerals. Indicated preventive strategies targeting individuals who display suicidal behaviour should focus on available pharmacological and psychological treatments of mental disorders, ensuring proper follow-up and chain of care by increased use of telemedicine and other digital means.

We aimed to assess the number of institutional births, their outcomes (institutional stillbirth and neonatal mortality rate), and quality of intrapartum care before and during the national COVID-19 lockdown in Nepal.\r\n\r\nIn this prospective observational study, we collected participant-level data for pregnant women enrolled in the SUSTAIN and REFINE studies between Jan 1 and May 30, 2020, from nine hospitals in Nepal. This period included 12\u00b75 weeks before the national lockdown and 9\u00b75 weeks during the lockdown. Women were eligible for inclusion if they had a gestational age of 22 weeks or more, a fetal heart sound at time of admission, and consented to inclusion. Women who had multiple births and their babies were excluded. We collected information on demographic and obstetric characteristics via extraction from case notes and health worker performance via direct observation by independent clinical researchers. We used regression analyses to assess changes in the number of institutional births, quality of care, and mortality before lockdown versus during lockdown.\r\n\r\nOf 22 907 eligible women, 21 763 women were enrolled and 20 354 gave birth, and health worker performance was recorded for 10 543 births. From the beginning to the end of the study period, the mean weekly number of births decreased from 1261\u00b71 births (SE 66\u00b71) before lockdown to 651\u00b74 births (49\u00b79) during lockdown-a reduction of 52\u00b74%. The institutional stillbirth rate increased from 14 per 1000 total births before lockdown to 21 per 1000 total births during lockdown (p=0\u00b70002), and institutional neonatal mortality increased from 13 per 1000 livebirths to 40 per 1000 livebirths (p=0\u00b70022). In terms of quality of care, intrapartum fetal heart rate monitoring decreased by 13\u00b74% (-15\u00b74 to -11\u00b73; p<0\u00b70001), and breastfeeding within 1 h of birth decreased by 3\u00b75% (-4\u00b76 to -2\u00b76; p=0\u00b70032). The immediate newborn care practice of placing the baby skin-to-skin with their mother increased by 13\u00b72% (12\u00b71 to 14\u00b75; p<0\u00b70001), and health workers' hand hygiene practices during childbirth increased by 12\u00b79% (11\u00b78 to 13\u00b79) during lockdown (p<0\u00b70001).\r\n\r\nInstitutional childbirth reduced by more than half during lockdown, with increases in institutional stillbirth rate and neonatal mortality, and decreases in quality of care. Some behaviours improved, notably hand hygiene and keeping the baby skin-to-skin with their mother.

analysis data. However, some startling information is gathered in terms of reduced premature mortality cases associated with air and water quality improvement, enhanced e-learning on a broader platform, work from home, and successful e-health. The decline in vehicular density on roads and congestion leads to reduced energy consumption and associated greenhouse gases (GHG) and other pollutants emission. The lockdown has also been identified as a possible emergency measure to combat severe air pollution episodes. Similarly, industrial pollution has been recognized as one of the primary causes of water resource pollution and would, therefore, bring change in policy vis-\u00e0-vis groundwater pollution control. Our findings suggest that the results of successful e-learning and work from home would be a permanent shift from conventional modes in the near future due to a drastic reduction in socio-economic cost.

All expected deaths from COVID-19 in nursing homes and hospitals were compared with, and contrasted to, deaths in a reference population (deaths in 2019).\n\nA total of 1346 expected COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes (n = 908) and hospitals (n = 438) were analyzed.

Fewer EOL discussions with patients were held compared with deaths in 2019 (74% vs. 79%, P < 0.001), and dying with someone present was much more uncommon (59% vs. 83%, P < 0.0001). In comparisons between nursing homes and hospital deaths, more patients dying in nursing homes were women (56% vs. 37%, P < 0.0001), and significantly fewer had a retained ability to express their will during the last week of life (54% vs. 89%, P < 0.0001).

Additionally, we tested the binding affinity of photoproducts identified after irradiation of phenothiazines with Nd:YAG laser beam at 266 nm respectively 355 nm. Our results reveal that thioridazine and its identified photoproducts (mesoridazine and sulforidazine) have high biological activity on the virus Mpro. This shows that thioridazine and its two photoproducts might represent new potent medicines to be used for treatment in this outbreak.

There is much evidence that air transport creates opportunities as well as risks. While the former accrue to businesses and individuals, risks are imposed on society. Pandemics, in which aviation has a role as a vector of pathogen distribution, as well as the sector's contribution to climate change are examples of long-standing negative externalities that continue to be ignored in assessments of aviation's economic performance and societal importance. As commercial aviation has shown limited economic resilience throughout its history, this short paper questions whether a return to business-as-usual, supported by very significant State aid payments, is desirable.

All consecutive acute admissions to emergency departments and cardiology departments throughout a 1-month period during the COVID-19 outbreak were compared with an equivalent 1-month period in 2019. The acute admissions to cardiology departments were classified into 5 major categories: acute coronary syndrome, acute heart failure, arrhythmia, pulmonary embolism, and other.\n\nData from 54,331 patients were collected and analyzed. Nine centers provided data on acute admissions to emergency departments comprising 50,384 patients: 20,226 in 2020 compared with 30,158 in 2019 (incidence rate ratio [IRR] with 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 0.66 [0.58-0.76]).

At implantation, the endometrial stroma, glands, arteries and immune cells undergo anatomical and functional transformation to create the decidua, the specialized secretory endometrium of pregnancy. The maternal decidua and the invading fetal trophoblast constitute a dynamic junction that facilitates a complex immunological dialogue between the two. The decidual and peripheral immune systems together assume a pivotal role in regulating the critical balance between tolerance and defense against infection. Throughout pregnancy, this equilibrium is repeatedly subjected to microbial challenge. Acute viral infection in pregnancy is associated with a wide spectrum of adverse consequences for both mother and fetus. Vertical transmission from mother to fetus can cause developmental anomalies, growth restriction, preterm birth and stillbirth, while the mother is predisposed to heightened morbidity and maternal death. A rapid, effective response to invasive pathogens is therefore essential in order to avoid overwhelming maternal infection and consequent fetal compromise. This sentinel response is mediated by the innate immune system: a heritable, highly evolutionarily conserved system comprising physical barriers, antimicrobial peptides (AMP) and a variety of immune cells-principally neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells-which express pattern-receptors that detect invariant molecular signatures unique to pathogenic micro-organisms. Recognition of these signatures during acute infection triggers signaling cascades that enhance antimicrobial properties such as phagocytosis, secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of the complement system. As well as coordinating the initial immune response, macrophages and dendritic cells present microbial antigens to lymphocytes, initiating and influencing the development of specific, long-lasting adaptive immunity. Despite extensive progress in unraveling the immunological adaptations of pregnancy, pregnant women remain particularly susceptible to certain acute viral infections and continue to experience mortality rates equivalent to those observed in pandemics several decades ago. Here, we focus specifically on the pregnancy-induced vulnerabilities in innate immunity that contribute to the disproportionately high maternal mortality observed in the following acute viral infections: Lassa fever, Ebola virus disease (EVD), dengue fever, hepatitis E, influenza, and novel coronavirus infections.", "doi": "10.3389/fimmu.2020.572567", "pmid": "33101294", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7556209"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-26T12:26:42.810Z", "modified": "2020-11-27T11:47:54.134Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "37842769c6394a15b1f9ad6e57ec202a", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/37842769c6394a15b1f9ad6e57ec202a.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/37842769c6394a15b1f9ad6e57ec202a"}}, "title": "Updated guidance on the management of COVID-19: from an American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society coordinated International Task Force (29 July 2020).", "authors": [{"family": "Bai", "given": "Chunxue", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Chotirmall", "given": "Sanjay H", "initials": "SH"}, {"family": "Rello", "given": "Jordi", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Alba", "given": "George A", "initials": "GA"}, {"family": "Ginns", "given": "Leo C", "initials": "LC"}, {"family": "Krishnan", "given": "Jerry A", "initials": "JA"}, {"family": "Rogers", "given": "Robert", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Bendstrup", "given": "Elisabeth", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Burgel", "given": "Pierre-Regis", "initials": "PR"}, {"family": "Chalmers", "given": "James D", "initials": "JD"}, {"family": "Chua", "given": "Abigail", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Crothers", "given": "Kristina A", "initials": "KA"}, {"family": "Duggal", "given": "Abhijit", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Kim", "given": "Yeon Wook", "initials": "YW"}, {"family": "Laffey", "given": "John G", "initials": "JG"}, {"family": "Luna", "given": "Carlos M", "initials": "CM"}, {"family": "Niederman", "given": "Michael S", "initials": "MS"}, {"family": "Raghu", "given": "Ganesh", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Ramirez", "given": "Julio A", "initials": "JA"}, {"family": "Riera", "given": "Jordi", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Roca", "given": "Oriol", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Tamae-Kakazu", "given": "Maximiliano", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Torres", "given": "Antoni", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Watkins", "given": "Richard R", "initials": "RR"}, {"family": "Barrecheguren", "given": "Miriam", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Belliato", "given": "Mirko", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Chami", "given": "Hassan A", "initials": "HA"}, {"family": "Chen", "given": "Rongchang", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Cortes-Puentes", "given": "Gustavo A", "initials": "GA"}, {"family": "Delacruz", "given": "Charles", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Hayes", "given": "Margaret M", "initials": "MM"}, {"family": "Heunks", "given": "Leo M A", "initials": "LMA"}, {"family": "Holets", "given": "Steven R", "initials": "SR"}, {"family": "Hough", "given": "Catherine L", "initials": "CL"}, {"family": "Jagpal", "given": "Sugeet", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Jeon", "given": "Kyeongman", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Johkoh", "given": "Takeshi", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Lee", "given": "May M", "initials": "MM"}, {"family": "Liebler", "given": "Janice", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "McElvaney", "given": "Gerry N", "initials": "GN"}, {"family": "Moskowitz", "given": "Ari", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Oeckler", "given": "Richard A", "initials": "RA"}, {"family": "Ojanguren", "given": "I\u00f1igo", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "O'Regan", "given": "Anthony", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Pletz", "given": "Mathias W", "initials": "MW"}, {"family": "Rhee", "given": "Chin Kook", "initials": "CK"}, {"family": "Schultz", "given": "Marcus J", "initials": "MJ"}, {"family": "Storti", "given": "Enrico", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Strange", "given": "Charlie", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Thomson", "given": "Carey C", "initials": "CC"}, {"family": "Torriani", "given": "Francesca J", "initials": "FJ"}, {"family": "Wang", "given": "Xun", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "Wuyts", "given": "Wim", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Xu", "given": "Tao", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Yang", "given": "Dawei", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Zhang", "given": "Ziqiang", "initials": "Z"}, {"family": "Wilson", "given": "Kevin C", "initials": "KC"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-30", "journal": {"title": "Eur Respir Rev", "issn": "1600-0617", "volume": "29", "issue": "157", "issn-l": "0905-9180"}, "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2.

Little is known about whether social distancing and other societal changes has provoked an increase in gambling, whether decreased betting opportunities due to paused sports events spurred gamblers to transition to online casino gambling, or whether any of these factors have had an impact on problem gambling. Methods: Data on lookup queries against the Swedish Gambling Paus registry, logging all initiated gambling sessions by all licensed gambling providers, from 2019-01-01 (start of registry) to 2020-04-08 (well into the first phase of the outbreak) were analyzed using TBATS time series forecasting to estimate trends after the first domestic COVID-19 death. Obfuscated data on daily total wagered and deposited amounts, split by modality (casino or betting, and low and high intensity, respectively) for the equivalent period were supplied by a licensed online gambling provider. Results: Total gambling activity decreased by 13.29% during the first phase of the outbreak compared to forecast. Analyses of online gambling data revealed that although betting decreased substantially in synchrony with a slight increase in online casino gambling, there was no increase in likely problematic, high-intensity gambling and neither did total online gambling increase. Conclusions: This first, preliminary study revealed no increase in Swedish gambling activity, total or specifically online, in the first phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. Future research should examine whether pandemic-induced transitioning between gambling modalities and/or increased participation in gambling, leads to long-term effects on prevalence of problem gambling.", "doi": "10.3389/fpubh.2020.554542", "pmid": "33117770", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7550730"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-01T15:10:25.688Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:46:13.110Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "252e6e3b499a4f00b054837e86a9f448", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/252e6e3b499a4f00b054837e86a9f448.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/252e6e3b499a4f00b054837e86a9f448"}}, "title": "Presence of SARS-CoV-2 in urine is rare and not associated with acute kidney injury in critically ill COVID-19 patients.", "authors": [{"family": "Frithiof", "given": "Robert", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Bergqvist", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "J\u00e4rhult", "given": "Josef D", "initials": "JD"}, {"family": "Lipcsey", "given": "Miklos", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Hultstr\u00f6m", "given": "Michael", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-29", "journal": {"title": "Crit Care", "issn": "1466-609X", "issn-l": "1364-8535", "volume": "24", "issue": "1", "pages": "587"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1186/s13054-020-03302-w", "pmid": "32993742", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Funder: KAW/SciLifeLab": null, "Funder: VR": null, "Research Area: Biobanks for COVID-19 research": null, "Category: Biochemistry": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "NA", "key": "Available on request", "description": null}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-10-30T11:37:02.479Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:45:02.895Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "5ed913f6997047d098f6186a54cff8bb", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/5ed913f6997047d098f6186a54cff8bb.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/5ed913f6997047d098f6186a54cff8bb"}}, "title": "MAIT cell activation and dynamics associated with COVID-19 disease severity.", "authors": [{"family": "Parrot", "given": "Tiphaine", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Gorin", "given": "Jean-Baptiste", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Ponzetta", "given": "Andrea", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Maleki", "given": "Kimia T", "initials": "KT"}, {"family": "Kammann", "given": "Tobias", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Emg\u00e5rd", "given": "Johanna", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Perez-Potti", "given": "Andr\u00e9", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Sekine", "given": "Takuya", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Rivera-Ballesteros", "given": "Olga", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Karolinska COVID-19 Study Group", "given": "", "initials": ""}, {"family": "Gredmark-Russ", "given": "Sara", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Rooyackers", "given": "Olav", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Folkesson", "given": "Elin", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Eriksson", "given": "Lars I", "initials": "LI"}, {"family": "Norrby-Teglund", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Ljunggren", "given": "Hans-Gustaf", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Bj\u00f6rkstr\u00f6m", "given": "Niklas K", "initials": "NK"}, {"family": "Aleman", "given": "Soo", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Buggert", "given": "Marcus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Klingstr\u00f6m", "given": "Jonas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Str\u00e5lin", "given": "Kristoffer", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Sandberg", "given": "Johan K", "initials": "JK"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-28", "journal": {"title": "Sci Immunol", "issn": "2470-9468", "issn-l": "2470-9468", "volume": "5", "issue": "51", "pages": null}, "abstract": "Severe COVID-19 is characterized by excessive inflammation of the lower airways.

Genome-wide association studies were performed by Illumina chips. Higher levels of sACE2 were statistically significantly associated with male sex, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and older age. The sACE2 level was most strongly associated with the levels of GDF-15, NT-proBNP, and hs-cTnT. When adjusting for these biomarkers, only male sex remained associated with sACE2. We found no statistically significant genetic regulation of the sACE2 level.\r\n\r\nMale sex and clinical or biomarker indicators of biological ageing, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes are associated with higher sACE2 levels. The levels of GDF-15 and NT-proBNP, which are associated both with the sACE2 level and a higher risk for mortality and cardiovascular disease, might contribute to better identification of risk for severe COVID-19 infection.", "doi": "10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa697", "pmid": "32984892", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "5912214"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7543499"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-17T18:09:17.932Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:45:48.463Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "308f9d1f08cb40baba508a70b7f74083", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/308f9d1f08cb40baba508a70b7f74083.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/308f9d1f08cb40baba508a70b7f74083"}}, "title": "Characteristics and short-term obstetric outcomes in a case series of 67 women test-positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Stockholm, Sweden.", "authors": [{"family": "Remaeus", "given": "Katarina", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Savchenko", "given": "Julia", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Brismar Wendel", "given": "Sophia", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Brusell Gidl\u00f6f", "given": "Sebastian", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Graner", "given": "Sophie", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Jones", "given": "Elin", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Molin", "given": "Johanna", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Saltvedt", "given": "Sissel", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Wallstr\u00f6m", "given": "Tove", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Pettersson", "given": "Karin", "initials": "K"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-27", "journal": {"title": "Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand", "issn": "1600-0412", "volume": "99", "issue": "12", "pages": "1626-1631", "issn-l": "0001-6349"}, "abstract": "The Stockholm region was the first area in Sweden to be hit by the pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The epidemic phase (27th January-15th February) exhibited rapidly increasing numbers of new daily cases, decreasing expression of negative emotions (a decrease of 27.3 negative comments per post per day, 95% CI -40.4 to -14.2), and a stabilized level of self-limiting mobility. The relief phase (16th February-31st March) had a steady decline in new daily cases and decreasing levels of negative emotion and self-limiting mobility.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 outbreak in China, the public's emotional reaction was strongest before the actual peak of the outbreak and declined thereafter.

Larger declines were seen in European than Asian cities. The COVID-19 Government Response Stringency Index was strongly associated with declines in mobility (r = - 0.75, p < 0.001). After adjusting for time-trends, we observed that implementing non-pharmaceutical countermeasures was associated with a decline of mobility of 10.0% for school closures (95% CI: 4.36 to 15.7%), 15.0% for workplace closures (95% CI: 10.2 to 19.8%), 7.09% for cancelling public events (95% CI: 1.98 to 12.2%), 18.0% for closing public transport (95% CI: 6.74 to 29.2%), 13.3% for restricting internal movements (95% CI: 8.85 to 17.8%) and 5.30% for international travel controls (95% CI: 1.69 to 8.90). In contrast, as expected, there was no association between population mobility changes and fiscal or monetary measures or emergency healthcare investment.\n\nUnderstanding the effect of public policy on mobility in the early stages is crucial to slowing and reducing COVID-19 transmission.

Here, we describe methods circumventing RNA extraction in COVID-19 testing by performing RT-PCR directly on heat-inactivated or lysed samples. Our data, including benchmarking using 597 clinical patient samples and a standardised diagnostic system, demonstrate that direct RT-PCR is viable option to extraction-based tests. Using controlled amounts of active SARS-CoV-2, we confirm effectiveness of heat inactivation by plaque assay and evaluate various generic buffers as transport medium for direct RT-PCR.

Despite the great effort put in the development of vaccines and specific treatments, no prophylaxis or effective therapeutics are currently available.

Given the potential of NO as treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we have evaluated the in vitro antiviral effect of NO on SARS-CoV-2 replication. The NO-donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) had a dose dependent inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 replication, while the non S-nitrosated NAP was not active, as expected. Although the viral replication was not completely abolished (at 200 \u03bcM and 400 \u03bcM), SNAP delayed or completely prevented the development of viral cytopathic effect in treated cells, and the observed protective effect correlated with the level of inhibition of the viral replication. The capacity of the NO released from SNAP to covalently bind and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL recombinant protease in vitro was also tested. The observed reduction in SARS-CoV-2 protease activity was consistent with S-nitrosation of the enzyme active site cysteine.", "doi": "10.1016/j.redox.2020.101734", "pmid": "33007504", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Funder: KAW/SciLifeLab": null, "Funder: VR": null, "Research Area: Drug discovery and repurposing of drugs": null, "Category: Imaging": null, "Category: Proteins": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "URL", "key": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2020.101734", "description": "Supplementary data"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-10-30T11:25:59.730Z", "modified": "2021-03-08T17:27:51.276Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "755e672d6e4b461c92ec69293c239cf2", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/755e672d6e4b461c92ec69293c239cf2.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/755e672d6e4b461c92ec69293c239cf2"}}, "title": "Crisis Management by Journal Editors: Case of COVID-19.", "authors": [{"family": "Sorooshian", "given": "Shahryar", "initials": "S"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-21", "journal": {"title": "J Korean Med Sci", "issn": "1598-6357", "volume": "35", "issue": "37", "pages": "e320", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e320", "pmid": "32959545", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "35.e320"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7505727"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-03T09:25:25.650Z", "modified": "2020-12-03T09:25:25.675Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "b8e24bc4dbf245908a5bf678a0c3b0b9", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/b8e24bc4dbf245908a5bf678a0c3b0b9.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/b8e24bc4dbf245908a5bf678a0c3b0b9"}}, "title": "Serology assessment of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19 by rapid IgM/IgG antibody test.", "authors": [{"family": "De Marinis", "given": "Yang", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Sunnerhagen", "given": "Torgny", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Bompada", "given": "Pradeep", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Bl\u00e4ckberg", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Yang", "given": "Runtao", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Svensson", "given": "Joel", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Ekstr\u00f6m", "given": "Ola", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Eriksson", "given": "Karl-Fredrik", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Hansson", "given": "Ola", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Groop", "given": "Leif", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Gon\u00e7alves", "given": "Isabel", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Rasmussen", "given": "Magnus", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-20", "journal": {"title": "Infect Ecol Epidemiol", "issn": "2000-8686", "issn-l": "2000-8686", "volume": "10", "issue": "1", "pages": "1821513"}, "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created a global health- and economic crisis.

Responding to the pandemic, Sweden has taken a different approach aiming to mitigate, not suppress, community transmission, by using physical distancing without lockdowns. Here we contrast the consequences of different responses to COVID-19 within Sweden, the resulting demand for care, intensive care, the death tolls and the associated direct healthcare related costs.\n\nWe used an age-stratified health-care demand extended SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) compartmental model for all municipalities in Sweden, and a radiation model for describing inter-municipality mobility. The model was calibrated against data from municipalities in the Stockholm healthcare region.\n\nOur scenario with moderate to strong physical distancing describes well the observed health demand and deaths in Sweden up to the end of May 2020. In this scenario, the intensive care unit (ICU) demand reaches the pre-pandemic maximum capacity just above 500 beds. In the counterfactual scenario, the ICU demand is estimated to reach \u223c20 times higher than the pre-pandemic ICU capacity. The different scenarios show quite different death tolls up to 1 September, ranging from 5000 to 41 000, excluding deaths potentially caused by ICU shortage. Additionally, our statistical analysis of all causes excess mortality indicates that the number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 could be increased by 40% (95% confidence interval: 0.24, 0.57).\n\nThe results of this study highlight the impact of different combinations of non-pharmaceutical interventions, especially moderate physical distancing in combination with more effective isolation of infectious individuals, on reducing deaths, health demands and lowering healthcare costs. In less effective mitigation scenarios, the demand on ICU beds would rapidly exceed capacity, showing the tight interconnection between the healthcare demand and physical distancing in the society. These findings have relevance for Swedish policy and response to the COVID-19 pandemic and illustrate the importance of maintaining the level of physical distancing for a longer period beyond the study period to suppress or mitigate the impacts from the pandemic.", "doi": "10.1093/ije/dyaa121", "pmid": "32954400", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "5909271"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7543571"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-03T09:31:56.254Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:46:13.454Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "865012848aa3469da99c9e119fb80623", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/865012848aa3469da99c9e119fb80623.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/865012848aa3469da99c9e119fb80623"}}, "title": "COVID Isolation Eating Scale (CIES): Analysis of the impact of confinement in eating disorders and obesity-A collaborative international study.", "authors": [{"family": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Aranda", "given": "Fernando", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Mungu\u00eda", "given": "Lucero", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Mestre-Bach", "given": "Gemma", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Steward", "given": "Trevor", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Etxandi", "given": "Mikel", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Baenas", "given": "Isabel", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Granero", "given": "Roser", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "S\u00e1nchez", "given": "Isabel", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Ortega", "given": "Emilio", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Andreu", "given": "Alba", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Moize", "given": "Violeta L", "initials": "VL"}, {"family": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Real", "given": "Jose M", "initials": "JM"}, {"family": "Tinahones", "given": "Francisco J", "initials": "FJ"}, {"family": "Dieg\u00fcez", "given": "Carlos", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Fr\u00fchbeck", "given": "Gema", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Le Grange", "given": "Daniel", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Tchanturia", "given": "Kate", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Karwautz", "given": "Andreas", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Zeiler", "given": "Michael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Favaro", "given": "Angela", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Claes", "given": "Laurence", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Luyckx", "given": "Koen", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Shekriladze", "given": "Ia", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Serrano-Troncoso", "given": "Eduardo", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Rangil", "given": "Teresa", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Meler", "given": "Maria Eulalia Loran", "initials": "MEL"}, {"family": "Soriano-Pacheco", "given": "Jose", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Carceller-Sindreu", "given": "Mar", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Bujalance-Arguijo", "given": "Sara", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Lozano", "given": "Meritxell", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Linares", "given": "Raquel", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Gudiol", "given": "Carlota", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Carratala", "given": "Jordi", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Sanchez-Gonzalez", "given": "Jessica", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Machado", "given": "Paulo Pp", "initials": "PP"}, {"family": "H\u00e5kansson", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "T\u00fary", "given": "Ferenc", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "P\u00e1szthy", "given": "Bea", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Stein", "given": "Daniel", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Papezov\u00e1", "given": "Hana", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Bax", "given": "Brigita", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Borisenkov", "given": "Mikhail F", "initials": "MF"}, {"family": "Popov", "given": "Sergey V", "initials": "SV"}, {"family": "Kim", "given": "Youl-Ri", "initials": "YR"}, {"family": "Nakazato", "given": "Michiko", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Godart", "given": "Nathalie", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "van Voren", "given": "Robert", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Ilnytska", "given": "Tetiana", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Chen", "given": "Jue", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Rowlands", "given": "Katie", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Treasure", "given": "Janet", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Jim\u00e9nez-Murcia", "given": "Susana", "initials": "S"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-20", "journal": {"title": "Eur Eat Disord Rev", "issn": "1099-0968", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have a serious and complex impact on the mental health of patients with an eating disorder (ED) and of patients with obesity.

Regarding the effects of confinement, positive and negative impacts of the confinement depends of the eating disorder subtype. Patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) and with obesity endorsed a positive response to treatment during confinement, no significant changes were found in bulimia nervosa (BN) patients, whereas Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (OSFED) patients endorsed an increase in eating symptomatology and in psychopathology. Furthermore, AN patients expressed the greatest dissatisfaction and accommodation difficulty with remote therapy when compared with the previously provided face-to-face therapy.

In this review, we explore sex-related differences that may be contributing factors to the observed male-biased mortality from COVID-19. Males are considered the weaker sex in aspects related to endurance and infection control. Studies show that viral RNA clearance is delayed in males with COVID-19. A recent study has indicated that the testis can harbor coronavirus, and consequently, males show delayed viral clearance. However, the role of testis involvement in COVID-19 severity and mortality needs further research. Males and females show a distinct difference in immune system responses with females eliciting stronger immune responses to pathogens. This difference in immune system responses may be a major contributing factor to viral load, disease severity, and mortality. In addition, differences in sex hormone milieus could also be a determinant of viral infections as estrogen has immunoenhancing effects while testosterone has immunosuppressive effects. The sex-specific severity of COVID-19 infections indicates that further research on understanding the sex differences is needed. Inclusion of both males and females in basic research and clinical trials is required to provide critical information on sex-related differences that may help to better understand disease outcome and therapy.", "doi": "10.1186/s13293-020-00330-7", "pmid": "32948238", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1186/s13293-020-00330-7"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7498997"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-27T12:42:10.704Z", "modified": "2020-12-03T15:25:40.954Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "6fb23dcb8a064f699cf2617168197bf2", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/6fb23dcb8a064f699cf2617168197bf2.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/6fb23dcb8a064f699cf2617168197bf2"}}, "title": "Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and risk of future sickness", "authors": [{"family": "Dillner", "given": "Joakim", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Elfstr\u00f6m", "given": "Miriam", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Blomqvist", "given": "Jonas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Eklund", "given": "Carina", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Lagheden", "given": "Camilla", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Nordqvist-Kleppe", "given": "Sara", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Hellstr\u00f6m", "given": "Cecilia", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Olofsson", "given": "Jennie", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Andersso", "given": "Eni", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Jernbom Falk", "given": "August", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Bergstr\u00f6m", "given": "Sofia", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Hultin", "given": "Emilie", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Pin", "given": "Elisa", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "M\u00e5nberg", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Hedhammar", "given": "My", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Hober", "given": "Sophia", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Mattsson", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Arroyo M\u00fchr", "given": "Laila Sara", "initials": "LS"}, {"family": "Conneryd Lundgren", "given": "Kalle", "initials": "K"}], "type": "posted-content", "published": "2020-09-18", "journal": {"title": "medRxiv", "issn": null, "issn-l": null, "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": null}, "abstract": "Background: The extent that antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 may protect against future virus-associated disease is unknown.

Associations between information sources, knowledge and two practices (washing hands with soap and avoiding crowds) were analysed using multilevel logistic regression models.\n\nWe found that 75% of the respondents felt at moderate or great risk of contracting coronavirus. A majority (70%) of women did not know you can survive COVID-19, compared with 61% of men. 60% of men and 54% of women had already taken action to avoid infection with the coronavirus, mostly washing hands with soap and water (87%). Radio (73%) was the most used source for COVID-19 information, followed by social media (39%). Having a medium or high level of knowledge was associated with higher odds of washing hands with soap (medium knowledge: adjusted OR (AOR) 2.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 4.4; high knowledge: AOR 4.6, 95% CI 2.1 to 10.2) and avoiding crowds (medium knowledge: AOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.6; high knowledge: AOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.3).\n\nThis study shows that in the context of COVID-19 in Sierra Leone, there is a strong association between knowledge and practices. Because the knowledge gap differs between genders, regions, educational levels and age, it is important that messages are specifically targeted to these core audiences.", "doi": "10.1136/bmjopen-2020-040328", "pmid": "32948576", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "bmjopen-2020-040328"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7500298"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-03T15:25:05.492Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:46:12.952Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "5dc281be97ab40e09602086957f75065", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/5dc281be97ab40e09602086957f75065.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/5dc281be97ab40e09602086957f75065"}}, "title": "Randomized elimination and prolongation of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in coronavirus 2019 (REPLACE COVID) Trial Protocol.", "authors": [{"family": "Cohen", "given": "Jordana B", "initials": "JB"}, {"family": "Hanff", "given": "Thomas C", "initials": "TC"}, {"family": "Corrales-Medina", "given": "Vicente", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "William", "given": "Preethi", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Renna", "given": "Nicolas", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Rosado-Santander", "given": "Nelson R", "initials": "NR"}, {"family": "Rodriguez-Mori", "given": "Juan E", "initials": "JE"}, {"family": "Spaak", "given": "Jonas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Andrade-Villanueva", "given": "Jaime", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Chang", "given": "Tara I", "initials": "TI"}, {"family": "Barbagelata", "given": "Alejandro", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Alfonso", "given": "Carlos E", "initials": "CE"}, {"family": "Bernales-Salas", "given": "Eduardo", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Coacalla", "given": "Johanna", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Castro-Callirgos", "given": "Carlos Augusto", "initials": "CA"}, {"family": "Tupayachi-Venero", "given": "Karen E", "initials": "KE"}, {"family": "Medina", "given": "Carola", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Valdivia", "given": "Renzo", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Villavicencio", "given": "Mirko", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Vasquez", "given": "Charles R", "initials": "CR"}, {"family": "Harhay", "given": "Michael O", "initials": "MO"}, {"family": "Chittams", "given": "Jesse", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Sharkoski", "given": "Tiffany", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Byrd", "given": "James Brian", "initials": "JB"}, {"family": "Edmonston", "given": "Daniel L", "initials": "DL"}, {"family": "Sweitzer", "given": "Nancy", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Chirinos", "given": "Julio A", "initials": "JA"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-16", "journal": {"title": "J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich)", "issn": "1751-7176", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": "1524-6175"}, "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is associated with high incidence of multiorgan dysfunction and death.

Most states have implemented similar NPIs at similar time points.

We utilise mobility data from Google mobility reports using five different categories: retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, transit stations, workplace and residential. The importance of each mobility category for predicting changes in R0 is estimated through the model.\r\n\r\nThe changes in mobility have a considerable overlap with the introduction of governmental NPIs, highlighting the importance of government action for population behavioural change. The shift in mobility in all categories shows high correlations with the death rates 1 month later. Reduction of movement within the grocery and pharmacy sector is estimated to account for most of the decrease in R0.\r\n\r\nOur model predicts 3-week epidemic forecasts, using real-time observations of changes in mobility patterns, which can provide governments with direct feedback on the effects of their NPIs. The model predicts the changes in a majority of the countries accurately but overestimates the impact of NPIs in Sweden and Denmark and underestimates them in France and Belgium. We also note that the exponential nature of all epidemiological models based on the basic reproductive number, R0 cause small errors to have extensive effects on the predicted outcome.", "doi": "10.7717/peerj.9879", "pmid": "32983643", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Funder: VR": null, "Category: Biochemistry": null, "Category: Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "URL", "key": "https://github.com/patrickbryant1/COVID19.github.io/tree/master/simulations/mobility", "description": "Modelling code and data"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-10-30T12:05:16.028Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:45:48.044Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "6186d266f41a4cd995e5edb8ec12c8fd", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/6186d266f41a4cd995e5edb8ec12c8fd.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/6186d266f41a4cd995e5edb8ec12c8fd"}}, "title": "Pandemic programming: How COVID-19 affects software developers and how their organizations can help.", "authors": [{"family": "Ralph", "given": "Paul", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Baltes", "given": "Sebastian", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Adisaputri", "given": "Gianisa", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Torkar", "given": "Richard", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Kovalenko", "given": "Vladimir", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Kalinowski", "given": "Marcos", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Novielli", "given": "Nicole", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Yoo", "given": "Shin", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Devroey", "given": "Xavier", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "Tan", "given": "Xin", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "Zhou", "given": "Minghui", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Turhan", "given": "Burak", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Hoda", "given": "Rashina", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Hata", "given": "Hideaki", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Robles", "given": "Gregorio", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Milani Fard", "given": "Amin", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Alkadhi", "given": "Rana", "initials": "R"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-14", "journal": {"title": "Empir Softw Eng", "issn": "1573-7616", "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": "1-35", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "As a novel coronavirus swept the world in early 2020, thousands of software developers began working from home.

Predisposing risk factors to severe COVID-19 are male sex, underlying cardiovascular disease, or cardiovascular risk factors including noncontrolled diabetes mellitus or arterial hypertension, obesity, and advanced age. The VAS-European Independent Foundation in Angiology/Vascular Medicine draws attention to patients with vascular disease (VD) and presents an integral strategy for the management of patients with VD or cardiovascular risk factors (VD-CVR) and COVID-19. VAS recommends (1) a COVID-19-oriented primary health care network for patients with VD-CVR for identification of patients with VD-CVR in the community and patients' education for disease symptoms, use of eHealth technology, adherence to the antithrombotic and vascular regulating treatments, and (2) close medical follow-up for efficacious control of VD progression and prompt application of physical and social distancing measures in case of new epidemic waves. For patients with VD-CVR who receive home treatment for COVID-19, VAS recommends assessment for (1) disease worsening risk and prioritized hospitalization of those at high risk and (2) VTE risk assessment and thromboprophylaxis with rivaroxaban, betrixaban, or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for those at high risk. For hospitalized patients with VD-CVR and COVID-19, VAS recommends (1) routine thromboprophylaxis with weight-adjusted intermediate doses of LMWH (unless contraindication); (2) LMWH as the drug of choice over unfractionated heparin or direct oral anticoagulants for the treatment of VTE or hypercoagulability; (3) careful evaluation of the risk for disease worsening and prompt application of targeted antiviral or convalescence treatments; (4) monitoring of D-dimer for optimization of the antithrombotic treatment; and (5) evaluation of the risk of VTE before hospital discharge using the IMPROVE-D-dimer score and prolonged post-discharge thromboprophylaxis with rivaroxaban, betrixaban, or LMWH.", "doi": "10.1055/s-0040-1715798", "pmid": "32920811", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-03T15:37:40.375Z", "modified": "2020-12-03T15:38:41.229Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "0b5aef6454014621b5298e639210e0c9", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/0b5aef6454014621b5298e639210e0c9.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/0b5aef6454014621b5298e639210e0c9"}}, "title": "Shedding of infectious SARS-CoV-2 from airways in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in relation to serum antibody responses", "authors": [{"family": "Glans", "given": "Hedvig", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Gredmark-Russ", "given": "Sara", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Olausson", "given": "Mikaela", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Falck-Jones", "given": "Sara", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Varnaite", "given": "Renata", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Christ", "given": "Wanda", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Maleki", "given": "Kimia T", "initials": "KT"}, {"family": "Lind Karlberg", "given": "Maria", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Broddesson", "given": "Sandra", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Falck-Jones", "given": "Ryan", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Bell", "given": "Max", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Johansson", "given": "Niclas", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Farnert", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Smed Sorensen", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Klingstrom", "given": "Jonas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Brave", "given": "Andreas", "initials": "A"}], "type": "posted-content", "published": "2020-09-13", "journal": {"title": "medRxiv", "issn": null, "issn-l": null, "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": null}, "abstract": "To understand the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized COVID-19 patients we simultaneously assessed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, live infectious virus in the airways, and virus-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies in sera in 36 hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

There are major concerns in Africa due to existing high prevalence rates for both infectious and non-infectious diseases and limited resources in terms of personnel, beds and equipment.

This could be due to a number of factors including early instigation of lockdown and border closures, the younger age of the population, lack of robust reporting systems and as yet unidentified genetic and other factors. Innovation is accelerating to address concerns with available equipment. There are ongoing steps to address the level of misinformation and its consequences including fines. There are also ongoing initiatives across Africa to start addressing the unintended consequences of COVID-19 activities including lockdown measures and their impact on NCDs including the likely rise in mental health disorders, exacerbated by increasing stigma associated with COVID-19. Strategies include extending prescription lengths, telemedicine and encouraging vaccination. However, these need to be accelerated to prevent increased morbidity and mortality.\n\nThere are multiple activities across Africa to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and address misinformation, which can have catastrophic consequences, assisted by the WHO and others, which appear to be working in a number of countries.

During the second quadratic growth phase, the characteristic time of the growth is about eight times shorter than in the beginning, which can be understood as the occurrence of separate hotspots. Quadratic behavior can be motivated by peripheral growth when further spreading occurs only on the outskirts of an infected region. We also study numerical solutions of a simple epidemic model, where the spatial extend of the system is taken into account. To model the delayed onset outside China together with the early one in China within a single model with minimal assumptions, we adopt an initial condition of several hotspots, of which one reaches saturation much earlier than the others.

The accuracy, adaptability, and cost-effectiveness of this test makes it an excellent option for clinical deployment in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.", "doi": "10.1128/mSphere.00224-21", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Category: Biochemistry": null, "Category: Health": null, "Category: Serology": null, "Category: Proteins": null, "Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "NA", "key": "Available on request", "description": null}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-04T15:35:31.660Z", "modified": "2021-04-23T04:34:32.198Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "c0dccb4b5d464861a2edc7e0621fa33f", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/c0dccb4b5d464861a2edc7e0621fa33f.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/c0dccb4b5d464861a2edc7e0621fa33f"}}, "title": "Covid-19 as cultural trauma.", "authors": [{"family": "Demertzis", "given": "Nicolas", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Eyerman", "given": "Ron", "initials": "R"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-10", "journal": {"title": "Am J Cult Sociol", "issn": "2049-7113", "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": "1-23", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "This paper has two aims.

Many people have suffered from symptoms like COVID-19 during this pandemic, and some people have cured without taking any treatment or taking minor pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. However, they might be spreading their infections among their family members and perhaps in the community. It is unsure that individuals with COVID-19-like symptoms are positive with COVID-19, but our concern is, during this pandemic, any types of symptoms such as flu-like symptoms should have been taken seriously. This study was observed in the cases from three families with COVID-19 like symptoms. Case presentation This observational study was done between May 20 and Jun 2, 2020, in Bangladesh. The members of the inspected families shared COVID-19 like symptoms that were lasted for 3-10 days.

The main receptor of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is now undergoing extensive scrutiny to understand the routes of transmission and sensitivity in different species. Here, we utilized a unique dataset of ACE2 sequences from 410 vertebrate species, including 252 mammals, to study the conservation of ACE2 and its potential to be used as a receptor by SARS-CoV-2. We designed a five-category binding score based on the conservation properties of 25 amino acids important for the binding between ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Only mammals fell into the medium to very high categories and only catarrhine primates into the very high category, suggesting that they are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We employed a protein structural analysis to qualitatively assess whether amino acid changes at variable residues would be likely to disrupt ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding and found the number of predicted unfavorable changes significantly correlated with the binding score. Extending this analysis to human population data, we found only rare (frequency <0.001) variants in 10/25 binding sites. In addition, we found significant signals of selection and accelerated evolution in the ACE2 coding sequence across all mammals, and specific to the bat lineage. Our results, if confirmed by additional experimental data, may lead to the identification of intermediate host species for SARS-CoV-2, guide the selection of animal models of COVID-19, and assist the

beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the treatment of patients with allergic and atopy-associated diseases has faced major challenges. Recommendations for \"social distancing\" and the fear of patients becoming infected during a visit to a medical facility have led to a drastic decrease in personal doctor-patient contacts. This affects both acute care and treatment of the chronically ill. The immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection is so far only insufficiently understood and could be altered in a favorable or unfavorable way by therapy with monoclonal antibodies. There is currently no evidence for an increased risk of a severe COVID-19 course in allergic patients. Many patients are under ongoing therapy with biologicals that inhibit type 2 immune responses via various mechanisms. There is uncertainty about possible immunological interactions and potential risks of these biologicals in the case of an infection with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nA selective literature search was carried out in PubMed, Livivo, and the internet to cover the past 10 years (May 2010 - April 2020). Additionally, the current German-language publications were analyzed. Based on these data, the present position paper provides recommendations for the biological treatment of patients with allergic and atopy-associated diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn order to maintain in-office consultation services, a safe treatment environment must be created that is adapted to the pandemic situation. To date, there is a lack of reliable study data on the care for patients with complex respiratory, atopic, and allergic diseases in times of an imminent infection risk from SARS-CoV-2. Type-2-dominant immune reactions, as they are frequently seen in allergic patients, could influence various phases of COVID-19, e.g., by slowing down the immune reactions. Theoretically, this could have an unfavorable effect in the early phase of a SARS-Cov-2 infection, but also a positive effect during a cytokine storm in the later phase of severe courses. However, since there is currently no evidence for this, all data from patients treated with a biological directed against type 2 immune reactions who develop COVID-19 should be collected in registries, and their disease courses documented in order to be able to provide experience-based instructions in the future.\n\nThe use of biologicals for the treatment of bronchial asthma, atopic dermatitis, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and spontaneous urticaria should be continued as usual in patients without suspected infection or proven SARS-CoV-2 infection. If available, it is recommended to prefer a formulation for self-application and to offer telemedical monitoring. Treatment should aim at the best possible control of difficult-to-control allergic and atopic diseases using adequate rescue and add-on therapy and should avoid the need for systemic glucocorticosteroids. If SARS-CoV-2 infection is proven or reasonably suspected, the therapy should be determined by weighing the benefits and risks individually for the patient in question, and the patient should be involved in the decision-making. It should be kept in mind that the potential effects of biologicals on the immune response in COVID-19 are currently not known. Telemedical offers are particularly desirable for the acute consultation needs of suitable patients.", "doi": "10.5414/ALX02166E", "pmid": "32915172", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7480069"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-03T15:49:30.607Z", "modified": "2020-12-03T15:49:30.629Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "ea3e7e32fe0a47af92fac82feeace707", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/ea3e7e32fe0a47af92fac82feeace707.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/ea3e7e32fe0a47af92fac82feeace707"}}, "title": "The Immunology of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children with COVID-19.", "authors": [{"family": "Consiglio", "given": "Camila Rosat", "initials": "CR"}, {"family": "Cotugno", "given": "Nicola", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Sardh", "given": "Fabian", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Pou", "given": "Christian", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Amodio", "given": "Donato", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Rodriguez", "given": "Lucie", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Tan", "given": "Ziyang", "initials": "Z"}, {"family": "Zicari", "given": "Sonia", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Ruggiero", "given": "Alessandra", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Pascucci", "given": "Giuseppe Rubens", "initials": "GR"}, {"family": "Santilli", "given": "Veronica", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Campbell", "given": "Tessa", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Bryceson", "given": "Yenan", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Eriksson", "given": "Daniel", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Wang", "given": "Jun", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Marchesi", "given": "Alessandra", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Lakshmikanth", "given": "Tadepally", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Campana", "given": "Andrea", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Villani", "given": "Alberto", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Rossi", "given": "Paolo", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "CACTUS Study Team", "given": "", "initials": ""}, {"family": "Landegren", "given": "Nils", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Palma", "given": "Paolo", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Brodin", "given": "Petter", "initials": "P"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-06", "journal": {"title": "Cell", "issn": "1097-4172", "volume": "183", "issue": "4", "pages": "968-981.e7", "issn-l": "0092-8674"}, "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is typically very mild and often asymptomatic in children.

Directly preventing this interaction presents an attractive possibility for suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of an alpaca-derived single domain antibody fragment, Ty1, that specifically targets the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, directly preventing ACE2 engagement. Ty1 binds the RBD with high affinity, occluding ACE2. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of the bound complex at 2.9 \u00c5 resolution reveals that Ty1 binds to an epitope on the RBD accessible in both the 'up' and 'down' conformations, sterically hindering RBD-ACE2 binding. While fusion to an Fc domain renders Ty1 extremely potent, Ty1 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus as a 12.8 kDa nanobody, which can be expressed in high quantities in bacteria, presenting opportunities for manufacturing at scale. Ty1 is therefore an excellent candidate as an intervention against COVID-19.", "doi": "10.1038/s41467-020-18174-5", "pmid": "32887876", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Funder: VR": null,

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of a rapidly spreading illness, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), affecting more than seventeen million people around the world. Diagnosis and treatment guidelines for clinicians caring for patients are needed. In the early stage, we have issued \"A rapid advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia (standard version)\"; now there are many direct evidences emerged and may change some of previous recommendations and it is ripe for develop an evidence-based guideline. We formed a working group of clinical experts and methodologists. The steering group members proposed 29 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19 covering the following areas: chemoprophylaxis, diagnosis, treatments, and discharge management. We searched the literature for direct evidence on the management of COVID-19, and assessed its certainty generated recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of ungraded consensus-based statement. Finally, we issued 34 statements. Among them, 6 were strong recommendations for, 14 were weak recommendations for, 3 were weak recommendations against and 11 were ungraded consensus-based statement. They covered topics of chemoprophylaxis (including agents and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) agents), diagnosis (including clinical manifestations, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respiratory tract specimens, IgM and IgG antibody tests, chest computed tomography, chest x-ray, and CT features of asymptomatic infections), treatments (including lopinavir-ritonavir, umifenovir, favipiravir, interferon, remdesivir, combination of antiviral drugs, hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, interleukin-6 inhibitors, interleukin-1 inhibitors, glucocorticoid, qingfei paidu decoction, lianhua qingwen granules/capsules, convalescent plasma, lung transplantation, invasive or noninvasive ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)), and discharge management (including discharge criteria and management plan in patients whose RT-PCR retesting shows SARS-CoV-2 positive after discharge).

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Robust analysis of outcomes for CLL patients, particularly examining effects of baseline characteristics and CLL-directed therapy, is critical to optimally manage CLL patients through this evolving pandemic. CLL patients diagnosed with symptomatic COVID-19 across 43 international centers (n = 198) were included. Hospital admission occurred in 90%. Median age at COVID-19 diagnosis was 70.5 years. Median Cumulative Illness Rating Scale score was 8 (range, 4-32). Thirty-nine percent were treatment naive (\"watch and wait\"), while 61% had received \u22651 CLL-directed therapy (median, 2; range, 1-8). Ninety patients (45%) were receiving active CLL therapy at COVID-19 diagnosis, most commonly Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi's; n = 68/90 [76%]). At a median follow-up of 16 days, the overall case fatality rate was 33%, though 25% remain admitted. Watch-and-wait and treated cohorts had similar rates of admission (89% vs 90%), intensive care unit admission (35% vs 36%), intubation (33% vs 25%), and mortality (37% vs 32%). CLL-directed treatment with BTKi's at COVID-19 diagnosis did not impact survival (case fatality rate, 34% vs 35%), though the BTKi was held during the COVID-19 course for most patients.

TEG with and without heparinase and anti-factor Xa analysis were performed. Standard thromboprophylaxis was given with dalteparin (75-100 IU/kg subcutaneously).\r\n\r\nFive patients (16%) had symptomatic thromboembolic events. All patients had a maximum amplitude (MA) > 65 mm and 13 (42%) had MA > 72 mm at some point during ICU stay. Anti-factor Xa activity were below the target range in 23% of the patients and above target range in 46% of patients.

We performed a retrospective analysis to compare and evaluate the effect of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) treatment on disease progression. For this purpose, the clinical records and laboratory indicators were extracted from electronic medical records of 42 patients with COVID-19 (21 of whom were treated with LMWH, and 21 without LMWH) hospitalized (Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology) from February 1 to March 15, 2020. Changes in the percentage of lymphocytes before and after LMWH treatment were significantly different from those in the control group (P = 0.011). Likewise, changes in the levels of D-dimer and fibrinogen degradation products in the LMWH group before and after treatment were significantly different from those in the control group (P = 0.035). Remarkably, IL-6 levels were significantly reduced after LMWH treatment (P = 0.006), indicating that, besides other beneficial properties, LMWH may exert an anti-inflammatory effect and attenuate in part the \"cytokine storm\" induced by the virus.

In this commentary, an analytical discursive approach was chosen to owe to Africa's unique situation of weak health systems, with most of its member states showing an initial reluctance to deal openly with the COVID-19 situation. This paper discusses five major control measures doped the SHEF2 Model i.e. (\"SHEF2\"- S: Social distancing, H: Hands, E: Elbows, F: Face, F: Feel) of COVID-19 implemented in Africa. We also review the issues related to implementing SHEF2 control measures in Africa. The measures being taken in Asia, Europe, and North America such as social distancing and regular hand washing are a particular challenge for African countries with dense populations, unequal access to water, and limited social safety nets. COVID-19 is challenging the public health and socio-political systems of all affected African countries. The burden of COVID-19 demands rapid and decisive action to be taken, yet the comparison shows how difficult it is was for an unknown new coronavirus disease. In line with the steps being taken across the globe to control and contain COVID-19 pandemic, African countries are preparing for the great effects of this pandemic and ensuing deep recession thus the reason we assert, the greater hope for African countries is implementing an aggressive SHEF2 model strategy.

It is possible to avoid the banality of evil, intended as lack of thinking on what we do when we do, by using the emergence of the emergency of COVID-19 as a Trojan horse to achieve some of the sustainable development goals such as universal health coverage and equity in access, thus acting on environmental factors is the key for global health improvement.", "doi": "10.1007/s42399-020-00486-8", "pmid": "32905109", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "486"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7462656"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-03T15:54:02.093Z", "modified": "2020-12-03T15:54:02.118Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "7ae6940fde8344e3bbf1e8e26cebc2d6", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7ae6940fde8344e3bbf1e8e26cebc2d6.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7ae6940fde8344e3bbf1e8e26cebc2d6"}}, "title": "COVID-19: how things change in a short while.", "authors": [{"family": "Stolfo", "given": "Davide", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Sinagra", "given": "Gianfranco", "initials": "G"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-01", "journal": {"title": "Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Pharmacother", "issn": "2055-6845", "volume": "6", "issue": "5", "pages": "280-281", "issn-l": "2055-6837"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1093/ehjcvp/pvaa092", "pmid": "32678899", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "5873153"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7454535"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-07T16:34:29.256Z", "modified": "2020-12-07T16:34:29.265Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "7325494cd545495586695b3c740af140", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7325494cd545495586695b3c740af140.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7325494cd545495586695b3c740af140"}}, "title": "Outcomes of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers in patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis.", "authors": [{"family": "Greco", "given": "Antonio", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Buccheri", "given": "Sergio", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "D'Arrigo", "given": "Paolo", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Calderone", "given": "Dario", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Agnello", "given": "Federica", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Monte", "given": "Marco", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Milluzzo", "given": "Rocco Paolo", "initials": "RP"}, {"family": "Franchina", "given": "Antonio Gabriele", "initials": "AG"}, {"family": "Ingala", "given": "Salvatore", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Capodanno", "given": "Davide", "initials": "D"}], "type": "letter", "published": "2020-09-01", "journal": {"title": "Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Pharmacother", "issn": "2055-6845", "volume": "6", "issue": "5", "pages": "335-337", "issn-l": "2055-6837"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1093/ehjcvp/pvaa074", "pmid": "32671399", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "5872101"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7454531"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-22T09:22:06.498Z", "modified": "2020-11-30T08:45:14.800Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "70b2e65b6cd84e38a2b89ed18da66416", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/70b2e65b6cd84e38a2b89ed18da66416.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/70b2e65b6cd84e38a2b89ed18da66416"}}, "title": "Association between eating behavior and quarantine/confinement stressors during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak.", "authors": [{"family": "Haddad", "given": "Chadia", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Zakhour", "given": "Maha", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Bou Kheir", "given": "Maria", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Haddad", "given": "Rima", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Al Hachach", "given": "Myriam", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Sacre", "given": "Hala", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Salameh", "given": "Pascale", "initials": "P"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-01", "journal": {"title": "J Eat Disord", "issn": "2050-2974", "volume": "8", "issue": null, "pages": "40", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Quarantine/confinement is an effective measure to face the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Damage to T lymphocytes along with the cytokine storm are important factors that lead to exacerbation of clinical cases. Here, we are proposing intravenous oxytocin (OXT) as a candidate for adjunctive therapy for COVID-19. OXT has anti-inflammatory and proimmune adaptive functions. Using the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS), we used the transcriptomic signature for carbetocin, an OXT agonist, and compared it to gene knockdown signatures of inflammatory (such as interleukin IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6) and proimmune markers (including T cell and macrophage cell markers like CD40 and ARG1). We found that carbetocin's transcriptomic signature has a pattern of concordance with inflammation and immune marker knockdown signatures that are consistent with reduction of inflammation and promotion and sustaining of immune response. This suggests that carbetocin may have potent effects in modulating inflammation, attenuating T cell inhibition, and enhancing T cell activation. Our results also suggest that carbetocin is more effective at inducing immune cell responses than either lopinavir or hydroxychloroquine, both of which have been explored for the treatment of COVID-19.", "doi": "10.1152/physiolgenomics.00095.2020", "pmid": "32809918", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Biochemistry": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-07T12:49:51.761Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:45:02.813Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "ff7fb22175a8472799663bb90467ac15", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/ff7fb22175a8472799663bb90467ac15.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/ff7fb22175a8472799663bb90467ac15"}}, "title": "Prioritizing Cleft/Craniofacial Surgical Care after the COVID-19 Pandemic.", "authors": [{"family": "Breugem", "given": "Corstiaan", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Smit", "given": "Hans", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Mark", "given": "Hans", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Davies", "given": "Gareth", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Schachner", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Collard", "given": "Mechelle", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Sell", "given": "Debbie", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Autelitano", "given": "Luca", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Rezzonico", "given": "Angela", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Mazzoleni", "given": "Fabio", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Novelli", "given": "Giorgio", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Mossey", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Persson", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Mehendale", "given": "Felicity", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Gaggl", "given": "Alexander", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "van Gogh", "given": "Christine", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Zuurbier", "given": "Petra", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Reinart", "given": "Siegmar", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "de Graaff", "given": "Feike", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Meazzini", "given": "Costanza", "initials": "C"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-00", "journal": {"title": "Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open", "issn": "2169-7574", "volume": "8", "issue": "9", "pages": "e3080", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "It is anticipated that in due course the burden of emergency care due to COVID-19 infected patients will reduce sufficiently to permit elective surgical procedures to recommence.

Unfortunately, social media use (especially problematic social media use) may give rise to psychological distress. Therefore, this study thus examined potential psychopathology to explain the association between problematic social media use, psychological distress, and insomnia.\n\nUtilizing an online survey, a sample of Iranian young adults (n = 1078 with 628 males; mean age = 26.24 years [SD \u00b1 7.41]) completed questions and psychometric scales concerning psychological distress, insomnia, problematic social media use, fear of COVID-19, and COVID-19 misunderstanding.\n\nProblematic social media use was significantly associated with psychological distress both directly and indirectly.

This study aimed to test whether levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in combination with D-dimer were predictors of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. The clinical characteristics of 305 COVID-19 patients were analysed and were compared between the survivor and non-survivor groups. Of the 305 patients, 85 (27.9%) died and 220 (72.1%) were discharged from hospital. Compared with discharged cases, non-survivor cases were older and their BUN and D-dimer levels were significantly higher (P < 0.0001). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariable Cox regression analyses identified BUN and D-dimer levels as independent risk factors for poor prognosis. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that elevated levels of BUN and D-dimer were associated with increased mortality (log-rank, P < 0.0001). The area under the curve for BUN combined with D-dimer was 0.94 (95% CI 0.90-0.97), with a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 91%. Based on BUN and D-dimer levels on admission, a nomogram model was developed that showed good discrimination, with a concordance index of 0.94. Together, initial BUN and D-dimer levels were associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients. The combination of BUN \u2265 4.6 mmol/L and D-dimer \u2265 0.845 \u03bcg/mL appears to identify patients at high risk of in-hospital mortality, therefore it may prove to be a powerful risk assessment tool for severe COVID-19 patients.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106110", "pmid": "32712332", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0924-8579(20)30293-4"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7377803"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-07T16:15:03.755Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:45:48.829Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "da6866a15f904121ace0557c7923f7b9", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/da6866a15f904121ace0557c7923f7b9.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/da6866a15f904121ace0557c7923f7b9"}}, "title": "Developing thinking around mental health science: the example of intrusive, emotional mental imagery after psychological trauma.", "authors": [{"family": "Singh", "given": "Laura", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Espinosa", "given": "Lisa", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Ji", "given": "Julie L", "initials": "JL"}, {"family": "Moulds", "given": "Michelle L", "initials": "ML"}, {"family": "Holmes", "given": "Emily A", "initials": "EA"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-00", "journal": {"title": "Cogn Neuropsychiatry", "issn": "1464-0619", "volume": "25", "issue": "5", "pages": "348-363", "issn-l": "1354-6805"}, "abstract": "One route to advancing psychological treatments is to harness mental health science, a multidisciplinary approach including individuals with lived experience and end users (e.g., Holmes, E.

While early days, we here illustrate a line of research explored by our group-intrusive imagery-based memories after trauma.\n\nWe illustrate three possible approaches through which mental health science may stimulate thinking around psychological treatment innovation. First, focusing on single/specific target symptoms rather than full, multifaceted psychiatric diagnoses (e.g., intrusive trauma memories rather than all of posttraumatic stress disorder). Second, investigating mechanisms that can be modified in treatment (treatment mechanisms), rather than those which cannot (e.g., processes only linked to aetiology). Finally, exploring novel ways of delivering psychological treatment (peer-/self-administration), given the prevalence of mental health problems globally, and the corresponding need for effective interventions that can be delivered at scale and remotely for example at times of crisis (e.g., current COVID-19 pandemic).\n\nThese three approaches suggest options for potential innovative avenues through which mental health science may be harnessed to recouple basic and applied research and transform treatment development.", "doi": "10.1080/13546805.2020.1804845", "pmid": "32847486", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-22T09:55:45.251Z", "modified": "2020-11-30T08:36:36.440Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "d9bdeca3f991438e9dec081348aa9da9", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/d9bdeca3f991438e9dec081348aa9da9.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/d9bdeca3f991438e9dec081348aa9da9"}}, "title": "Coagulation disorder in COVID-19.", "authors": [{"family": "Kander", "given": "Thomas", "initials": "T"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-00", "journal": {"title": "Lancet Haematol", "issn": "2352-3026", "volume": "7", "issue": "9", "pages": "e630-e632", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/S2352-3026(20)30218-0", "pmid": "32659213", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S2352-3026(20)30218-0"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7351400"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-08T14:11:45.590Z", "modified": "2020-12-08T14:11:45.611Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "cd3b5e14785c493a88046a386f265e86", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/cd3b5e14785c493a88046a386f265e86.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/cd3b5e14785c493a88046a386f265e86"}}, "title": "COVID-19: guidance on palliative care from a European Respiratory Society international task force.", "authors": [{"family": "Janssen", "given": "Daisy J A", "initials": "DJA"}, {"family": "Ekstr\u00f6m", "given": "Magnus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Currow", "given": "David C", "initials": "DC"}, {"family": "Johnson", "given": "Miriam J", "initials": "MJ"}, {"family": "Maddocks", "given": "Matthew", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Simonds", "given": "Anita K", "initials": "AK"}, {"family": "Tonia", "given": "Thomy", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Marsaa", "given": "Kristoffer", "initials": "K"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-00", "journal": {"title": "Eur Respir J", "issn": "1399-3003", "volume": "56", "issue": "3", "issn-l": "0903-1936"}, "abstract": "Many people are dying from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but consensus guidance on palliative care in COVID-19 is lacking.

Therefore, we aimed to make consensus recommendations for palliative care for patients with COVID-19 using the Convergence of Opinion on Recommendations and Evidence (CORE) process.\n\nWe invited 90 international experts to complete an online survey including stating their agreement, or not, with 14 potential recommendations. At least 70% agreement on directionality was needed to provide consensus recommendations.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is necessary to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection, but-owing to its essential metabolic roles-it may be difficult to target it in therapies. Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which interacts with ACE2, may be a better candidate for targeted therapies. Using publicly available expression data, we show that both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in many host tissues, including lung. The highest expression of ACE2 is found in the testes, whereas the prostate displays the highest expression of TMPRSS2. Given the increased severity of disease among older men with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we address the potential roles of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in their contribution to the sex differences in severity of disease. We show that expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are overall comparable between men and women in multiple tissues, suggesting that differences in the expression levels of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in the lung and other non-sex-specific tissues may not explain the gender disparities in severity of SARS CoV-2. However, given their instrumental roles for SARS-CoV-2 infection and their pleiotropic expression, targeting the activity and expression levels of TMPRSS2 is a rational approach to treat COVID-19.", "doi": "10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.06.018", "pmid": "32861340", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Biochemistry": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0025-6196(20)30626-1"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7368885"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-07T10:20:25.960Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:45:03.245Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "c4ef5f067c2a45bfba4aecc0e83e2ae4", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/c4ef5f067c2a45bfba4aecc0e83e2ae4.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/c4ef5f067c2a45bfba4aecc0e83e2ae4"}}, "title": "International Society for Extracellular Vesicles and International Society for Cell and Gene Therapy statement on extracellular vesicles from mesenchymal stromal cells and other cells: considerations for potential therapeutic agents to suppress coronavirus disease-19.", "authors": [{"family": "B\u00f6rger", "given": "Verena", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Weiss", "given": "Daniel J", "initials": "DJ"}, {"family": "Anderson", "given": "Johnathon D", "initials": "JD"}, {"family": "Borr\u00e0s", "given": "Francesc E", "initials": "FE"}, {"family": "Bussolati", "given": "Benedetta", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Carter", "given": "David R F", "initials": "DRF"}, {"family": "Dominici", "given": "Massimo", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Falc\u00f3n-P\u00e9rez", "given": "Juan M", "initials": "JM"}, {"family": "Gimona", "given": "Mario", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Hill", "given": "Andrew F", "initials": "AF"}, {"family": "Hoffman", "given": "Andrew M", "initials": "AM"}, {"family": "de Kleijn", "given": "Dominique", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Levine", "given": "Bruce L", "initials": "BL"}, {"family": "Lim", "given": "Rebecca", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "L\u00f6tvall", "given": "Jan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Mitsialis", "given": "S Alex", "initials": "SA"}, {"family": "Mongui\u00f3-Tortajada", "given": "Marta", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Muraca", "given": "Maurizio", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Nieuwland", "given": "Rienk", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Nowocin", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "O'Driscoll", "given": "Lorraine", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Ortiz", "given": "Luis A", "initials": "LA"}, {"family": "Phinney", "given": "Donald G", "initials": "DG"}, {"family": "Reischl", "given": "Ilona", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Rohde", "given": "Eva", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Sanzenbacher", "given": "Ralf", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Th\u00e9ry", "given": "Clotilde", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Toh", "given": "Wei Seong", "initials": "WS"}, {"family": "Witwer", "given": "Kenneth W", "initials": "KW"}, {"family": "Lim", "given": "Sai Kiang", "initials": "SK"}, {"family": "Giebel", "given": "Bernd", "initials": "B"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-00", "journal": {"title": "Cytotherapy", "issn": "1477-2566", "issn-l": "1465-3249", "volume": "22", "issue": "9", "pages": "482-485"}, "abstract": "The International Society for Cellular and Gene Therapies (ISCT) and the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) recognize the potential of extracellular vesicles (EVs, including exosomes) from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and possibly other cell sources as treatments for COVID-19.

Given that severe strokes are typically associated with poor prognosis and can be very efficiently treated with recanalization techniques, confirmation of this putative association is urgently warranted in a large representative patient cohort to alert stroke clinicians, and inform pre- and in-hospital acute stroke patient pathways. We pooled all consecutive patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and acute ischemic stroke in 28 sites from 16 countries. To assess whether stroke severity and outcomes (assessed at discharge or at the latest assessment for those patients still hospitalized) in patients with acute ischemic stroke are different between patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19, we performed 1:1 propensity score matching analyses of our COVID-19 patients with non-COVID-19 patients registered in the Acute Stroke Registry and Analysis of Lausanne Registry between 2003 and 2019. Between January 27, 2020, and May 19, 2020, 174 patients (median age 71.2 years; 37.9% females) with COVID-19 and acute ischemic stroke were hospitalized (median of 12 patients per site). The median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 10 (interquartile range [IQR], 4-18). In the 1:1 matched sample of 336 patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19, the median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was higher in patients with COVID-19 (10 [IQR, 4-18] versus 6 [IQR, 3-14]), P=0.03; (odds ratio, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.08-2.65] for higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score). There were 48 (27.6%) deaths, of which 22 were attributed to COVID-19 and 26 to stroke. Among 96 survivors with available information about disability status, 49 (51%) had severe disability at discharge.

We have conducted a survey to analyze caseload and measures to adapt indications for a perception of crisis.\n\nWe constructed a questionnaire to survey a snapshot of neurosurgical activity, resources, and indications during 1 week with usual activity in December 2019 and 1 week during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in March 2020. The questionnaire was sent to 34 neurosurgical departments in Europe; 25 departments returned responses within 5 days.\n\nWe found unexpectedly large differences in resources and indications already before the pandemic. Differences were also large in how much practice and resources changed during the pandemic. Neurosurgical beds and neuro-intensive care beds were significantly decreased from December 2019 to March 2020. The utilization of resources decreased via less demand for care of brain injuries and subarachnoid hemorrhage, postponing surgery and changed surgical indications as a method of rationing resources. Twenty departments (80%) reduced activity extensively, and the same proportion stated that they were no longer able to provide care according to legitimate medical needs.\n\nNeurosurgical centers responded swiftly and effectively to a sudden decrease of neurosurgical capacity due to relocation of resources to pandemic care. The pandemic led to rationing of neurosurgical care in 80% of responding centers. We saw a relation between resources before the pandemic and ability to uphold neurosurgical services. The observation of extensive differences of available beds provided an opportunity to show how resources that had been restricted already under normal conditions translated to rationing of care that may not be acceptable to the public of seemingly affluent European countries.", "doi": "10.1007/s00701-020-04482-8", "pmid": "32642834", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1007/s00701-020-04482-8"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7343382"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-08T14:30:29.037Z", "modified": "2020-12-08T14:30:29.046Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "b28bfa553b78495dabbac185e24c9ec3", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/b28bfa553b78495dabbac185e24c9ec3.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/b28bfa553b78495dabbac185e24c9ec3"}}, "title": "COVID-19 in people with multiple sclerosis: A global data sharing initiative.", "authors": [{"family": "Peeters", "given": "Liesbet M", "initials": "LM"}, {"family": "Parciak", "given": "Tina", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Walton", "given": "Clare", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Geys", "given": "Lotte", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Moreau", "given": "Yves", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "De Brouwer", "given": "Edward", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Raimondi", "given": "Daniele", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Pirmani", "given": "Ashkan", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Kalincik", "given": "Tomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Edan", "given": "Gilles", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Simpson-Yap", "given": "Steve", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "De Raedt", "given": "Luc", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Dauxais", "given": "Yann", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Gautrais", "given": "Cl\u00e9ment", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Rodrigues", "given": "Paulo R", "initials": "PR"}, {"family": "McKenna", "given": "Landon", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Lazovski", "given": "Nikola", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Hillert", "given": "Jan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Forsberg", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Spelman", "given": "Tim", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "McBurney", "given": "Robert", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Schmidt", "given": "Hollie", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Bergmann", "given": "Arnfin", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Braune", "given": "Stefan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Stahmann", "given": "Alexander", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Middleton", "given": "Rodden", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Salter", "given": "Amber", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Bebo", "given": "Bruce F", "initials": "BF"}, {"family": "Rojas", "given": "Juan I", "initials": "JI"}, {"family": "van der Walt", "given": "Anneke", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Butzkueven", "given": "Helmut", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "van der Mei", "given": "Ingrid", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Ivanov", "given": "Rumen", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Hellwig", "given": "Kerstin", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Sciascia do Olival", "given": "Guilherme", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Cohen", "given": "Jeffrey A", "initials": "JA"}, {"family": "Van Hecke", "given": "Wim", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Dobson", "given": "Ruth", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Magyari", "given": "Melinda", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Brum", "given": "Doralina Guimar\u00e3es", "initials": "DG"}, {"family": "Alonso", "given": "Ricardo", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Nicholas", "given": "Richard", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Bauer", "given": "Johana", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Chertcoff", "given": "Anibal", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "de S\u00e8ze", "given": "J\u00e9r\u00f4me", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Louapre", "given": "C\u00e9line", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Comi", "given": "Giancarlo", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Rijke", "given": "Nick", "initials": "N"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-00", "journal": {"title": "Mult Scler", "issn": "1477-0970", "volume": "26", "issue": "10", "pages": "1157-1162", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "We need high-quality data to assess the determinants for COVID-19 severity in people with MS (PwMS).

of venous thromboembolism during self-isolation if they have reduced mobility or are dehydrated. Should patients develop coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia requiring hospital admission for treatment of hypoxia, the risk for thromboembolic complications increases greatly. These thromboembolic events are the result of at least two distinct mechanisms - microvascular thrombosis in the pulmonary system (immunothrombosis) and hospital-associated venous thromboembolism. Since pregnancy is a prothrombotic state, there is concern regarding the potentially increased risk of thrombotic complications among pregnant women with COVID-19. To date, however, pregnant women do not appear to have a substantially increased risk of thrombotic complications related to COVID-19. Nevertheless, several organizations have vigilantly issued pregnancy-specific guidelines for thromboprophylaxis in COVID-19. Discrepancies between these guidelines reflect the altruistic wish to protect patients and lack of high-quality evidence available to inform clinical practice. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is the drug of choice for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with COVID-19. However, its utility in non-pregnant patients is only established against venous thromboembolism, as LMWH may have little or no effect on immunothrombosis. Decisions about initiation and duration of prophylactic anticoagulation in the context of pregnancy and COVID-19 must take into consideration disease severity, outpatient vs inpatient status, temporal relation between disease occurrence and timing of childbirth, and the underlying prothrombotic risk conferred by additional comorbidities. There is currently no evidence to recommend the use of intermediate or therapeutic doses of LMWH in thromboprophylaxis, which may increase bleeding risk without reducing thrombotic risk in pregnant patients with COVID-19. Likewise, there is no evidence to comment on the role of low-dose aspirin in thromboprophylaxis or of anti-cytokine and antiviral agents in preventing immunothrombosis. These unanswered questions are being studied within the context of clinical trials.", "doi": "10.1111/aogs.13962", "pmid": "32678949", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7404828"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-26T12:14:06.219Z", "modified": "2020-11-30T08:45:13.568Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "88f2b1b690ab477d9fe2589437f08ec1", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/88f2b1b690ab477d9fe2589437f08ec1.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/88f2b1b690ab477d9fe2589437f08ec1"}}, "title": "Towards pandemic preparedness beyond COVID-19", "authors": [{"family": "Naguib", "given": "Mahmoud M", "initials": "MM"}, {"family": "Ellstr\u00f6m", "given": "Patrik", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "J\u00e4rhult", "given": "Josef D", "initials": "JD"}, {"family": "Lundkvist", "given": "\u00c5ke", "initials": "\u00c5"}, {"family": "Olsen", "given": "Bj\u00f6rn", "initials": "B"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2020-09-00", "journal": {"title": "The Lancet Microbe", "issn": "2666-5247", "issn-l": "2666-5247", "volume": "1", "issue": "5", "pages": "e185-e186"}, "abstract": "Review", "doi": "10.1016/s2666-5247(20)30088-4", "pmid": "32838347", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-04T07:08:50.155Z", "modified": "2020-12-11T12:51:10.950Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "7df03080a93f4616927e9fdeb1a5576c", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7df03080a93f4616927e9fdeb1a5576c.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7df03080a93f4616927e9fdeb1a5576c"}}, "title": "Does prolonged propofol sedation of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients contribute to critical illness myopathy?", "authors": [{"family": "L\u00f6nnqvist", "given": "Per-Arne", "initials": "PA"}, {"family": "Bell", "given": "Max", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Karlsson", "given": "Torbj\u00f6rn", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Wiklund", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "H\u00f6glund", "given": "Anna-Stina", "initials": "AS"}, {"family": "Larsson", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}], "type": "letter", "published": "2020-09-00", "journal": {"title": "Br J Anaesth", "issn": "1471-6771", "volume": "125", "issue": "3", "pages": "e334-e336", "issn-l": "0007-0912"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.bja.2020.05.056", "pmid": "32600801", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0007-0912(20)30440-2"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7284264"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-22T08:45:29.899Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:45:48.396Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "679be0bb5b0c492f8c69165fadf5dfb2", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/679be0bb5b0c492f8c69165fadf5dfb2.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/679be0bb5b0c492f8c69165fadf5dfb2"}}, "title": "Predicted COVID-19 fatality rates based on age, sex, comorbidities and health system capacity.", "authors": [{"family": "Ghisolfi", "given": "Selene", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Alm\u00e5s", "given": "Ingvild", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Sandefur", "given": "Justin C", "initials": "JC"}, {"family": "von Carnap", "given": "Tillman", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Heitner", "given": "Jesse", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Bold", "given": "Tessa", "initials": "T"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-00", "journal": {"title": "BMJ Glob Health", "issn": "2059-7908", "volume": "5", "issue": "9", "issn-l": "2059-7908"}, "abstract": "Early reports suggest the fatality rate from COVID-19 varies greatly across countries, but non-random testing and incomplete vital registration systems render it impossible to directly estimate the infection fatality rate (IFR) in many low- and middle-income countries.

There were fears that health services would not be able to care for high numbers of COVID-19 patients. AIM To describe and review the emergency response of a public primary and community health-care organisation in Stockholm, Sweden, to the demand for care for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients during March-July 2020, and summarise preparations for the months to follow. METHODS This was a rapid implementation action research case study, which also draws on one author's experience as Chief Executive Officer and other members' experience in an emergency management group. RESULTS Sweden experienced similar mortality per million population to the UK, despite the different public health strategy used to address the COVID-19 outbreak. The Stockholm-integrated public primary and community health-care service, serving a population of 2.3 million, made many changes quickly. One change included coordinating non-acute private health-care services, following the local government emergency directive to do so. DISCUSSION It is possible that the fast and effective response by management and services in primary and community health care reduced infection and hospital demand, which contributed to a lower mortality than otherwise expected. The actions and preparations described for Stockholm's response may provide ideas for other health-care systems. The partnership research approach between the Karolinska Medical University and the Region Stockholm health-care system used in this project shows that rapid research methods have advantages for both partners in an emergency situation.", "doi": "10.1071/HC20082", "pmid": "32988442", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "HC20082"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-27T12:40:02.016Z", "modified": "2020-11-27T12:40:02.043Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "536b4d0da2254331a79a3bf4d5693abc", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/536b4d0da2254331a79a3bf4d5693abc.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/536b4d0da2254331a79a3bf4d5693abc"}}, "title": "Per capita death and infection rates should be avoided in international comparisons.", "authors": [{"family": "Silva", "given": "W T A F", "initials": "WTAF"}], "type": "letter", "published": "2020-09-00", "journal": {"title": "Public Health", "issn": "1476-5616", "volume": "186", "issue": null, "pages": "18-19", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.puhe.2020.06.038", "pmid": "32750504", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0033-3506(20)30276-6"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7395585"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-07T15:48:12.388Z", "modified": "2020-12-07T15:48:12.410Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "4bf14407a4204ed48d96d76ba237a0ca", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/4bf14407a4204ed48d96d76ba237a0ca.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/4bf14407a4204ed48d96d76ba237a0ca"}}, "title": "How can airborne transmission of COVID-19 indoors be minimised?", "authors": [{"family": "Morawska", "given": "Lidia", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Tang", "given": "Julian W", "initials": "JW"}, {"family": "Bahnfleth", "given": "William", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Bluyssen", "given": "Philomena M", "initials": "PM"}, {"family": "Boerstra", "given": "Atze", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Buonanno", "given": "Giorgio", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Cao", "given": "Junji", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Dancer", "given": "Stephanie", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Floto", "given": "Andres", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Franchimon", "given": "Francesco", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Haworth", "given": "Charles", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Hogeling", "given": "Jaap", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Isaxon", "given": "Christina", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Jimenez", "given": "Jose L", "initials": "JL"}, {"family": "Kurnitski", "given": "Jarek", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Li", "given": "Yuguo", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Loomans", "given": "Marcel", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Marks", "given": "Guy", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Marr", "given": "Linsey C", "initials": "LC"}, {"family": "Mazzarella", "given": "Livio", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Melikov", "given": "Arsen Krikor", "initials": "AK"}, {"family": "Miller", "given": "Shelly", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Milton", "given": "Donald K", "initials": "DK"}, {"family": "Nazaroff", "given": "William", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Nielsen", "given": "Peter V", "initials": "PV"}, {"family": "Noakes", "given": "Catherine", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Peccia", "given": "Jordan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Querol", "given": "Xavier", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "Sekhar", "given": "Chandra", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Sepp\u00e4nen", "given": "Olli", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Tanabe", "given": "Shin-Ichi", "initials": "SI"}, {"family": "Tellier", "given": "Raymond", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Tham", "given": "Kwok Wai", "initials": "KW"}, {"family": "Wargocki", "given": "Pawel", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Wierzbicka", "given": "Aneta", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Yao", "given": "Maosheng", "initials": "M"}], "type": "letter", "published": "2020-09-00", "journal": {"title": "Environ Int", "issn": "1873-6750", "volume": "142", "issue": null, "pages": "105832", "issn-l": "0160-4120"}, "abstract": "During the rapid rise in COVID-19 illnesses and deaths globally, and notwithstanding recommended precautions, questions are voiced about routes of transmission for this pandemic disease. Inhaling small airborne droplets is probable as a third route of infection, in addition to more widely recognized transmission via larger respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces. While uncertainties remain regarding the relative contributions of the different transmission pathways, we argue that existing evidence is sufficiently strong to warrant engineering controls targeting airborne transmission as part of an overall strategy to limit infection risk indoors. Appropriate building engineering controls include sufficient and effective ventilation, possibly enhanced by particle filtration and air disinfection, avoiding air recirculation and avoiding overcrowding. Often, such measures can be easily implemented and without much cost, but if only they are recognised as significant in contributing to infection control goals. We believe that the use of engineering controls in public buildings, including hospitals, shops, offices, schools, kindergartens, libraries, restaurants, cruise ships, elevators, conference rooms or public transport, in parallel with effective application of other controls (including isolation and quarantine, social distancing and hand hygiene), would be an additional important measure globally to reduce the likelihood of transmission and thereby protect healthcare workers, patients and the general public.", "doi": "10.1016/j.envint.2020.105832", "pmid": "32521345", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0160-4120(20)31787-6"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7250761"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-09T10:12:52.339Z", "modified": "2020-12-09T10:12:52.349Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "2e1cf5a5227047e5988485212dca347c", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/2e1cf5a5227047e5988485212dca347c.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/2e1cf5a5227047e5988485212dca347c"}}, "title": "The Rheumatologist's Role in the Battle Against COVID-19: Insights from the Front Line and Challenges for the Future.", "authors": [{"family": "Koutsianas", "given": "Christos", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Chatzidionysiou", "given": "Katerina", "initials": "K"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-00", "journal": {"title": "Mediterr J Rheumatol", "issn": "2529-198X", "volume": "31", "issue": "Suppl 2", "pages": "247-252", "issn-l": "2529-198X"}, "abstract": "As the worldwide burden of COVID-19 increases exponentially, healthcare systems are plagued by unprecedented pressure.

Clear advice on viral spread mitigation, precise guidelines on immunosuppressive treatment use and alternative methods of providing care, such as telemedicine, are a few of the rheumatologists' new challenges in caring for their patients in the COVID-19 era.

Given their vast experience in the use of biologic and targeted therapies, rheumatologists should lead the way in developing reliable scientific evidence for the optimal treatment of severe COVID-19.", "doi": "10.31138/mjr.31.3.247", "pmid": "33196000", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "MJR-31-Suppl-2-247"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7656125"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-27T09:54:48.746Z", "modified": "2020-11-27T09:54:48.765Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "2d4895ba0d5e42d19aad6ebf4d7163d5", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/2d4895ba0d5e42d19aad6ebf4d7163d5.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/2d4895ba0d5e42d19aad6ebf4d7163d5"}}, "title": "Age, Inflammation, and Disease Location Are Critical Determinants of Intestinal Expression of SARS-CoV-2 Receptor ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.", "authors": [{"family": "Nowak", "given": "Jan Krzysztof", "initials": "JK"}, {"family": "Lindstr\u00f8m", "given": "Jonas Christoffer", "initials": "JC"}, {"family": "Kalla", "given": "Rahul", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Ricanek", "given": "Petr", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Halfvarson", "given": "Jonas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Satsangi", "given": "Jack", "initials": "J"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-00", "journal": {"title": "Gastroenterology", "issn": "1528-0012", "issn-l": null, "volume": "159", "issue": "3", "pages": "1151-1154.e2"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1053/j.gastro.2020.05.030", "pmid": "32413354", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0016-5085(20)30653-3"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7217073"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-10T08:52:09.765Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:45:47.984Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "2a498dbc82a24be7b0fc3bbdfe878524", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/2a498dbc82a24be7b0fc3bbdfe878524.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/2a498dbc82a24be7b0fc3bbdfe878524"}}, "title": "Interventions for treatment of COVID-19: A living systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses (The LIVING Project).", "authors": [{"family": "Juul", "given": "Sophie", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Nielsen", "given": "Emil Eik", "initials": "EE"}, {"family": "Feinberg", "given": "Joshua", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Siddiqui", "given": "Faiza", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "J\u00f8rgensen", "given": "Caroline Kamp", "initials": "CK"}, {"family": "Barot", "given": "Emily", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Nielsen", "given": "Niklas", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Bentzer", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Veroniki", "given": "Areti Angeliki", "initials": "AA"}, {"family": "Thabane", "given": "Lehana", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Bu", "given": "Fanlong", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Klingenberg", "given": "Sarah", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Gluud", "given": "Christian", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Jakobsen", "given": "Janus Christian", "initials": "JC"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-00", "journal": {"title": "PLoS Med", "issn": "1549-1676", "volume": "17", "issue": "9", "pages": "e1003293", "issn-l": "1549-1277"}, "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly spreading disease that has caused extensive burden to individuals, families, countries, and the world. Effective treatments of COVID-19 are urgently needed.\n\nThis is the first edition of a living systematic review of randomized clinical trials comparing the effects of all treatment interventions for participants in all age groups with COVID-19. We planned to conduct aggregate data meta-analyses, trial sequential analyses, network meta-analysis, and individual patient data meta-analyses. Our systematic review is based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and Cochrane guidelines, and our 8-step procedure for better validation of clinical significance of meta-analysis results. We performed both fixed-effect and random-effects meta-analyses. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were admission to intensive care, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, quality of life, and nonserious adverse events. We used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess the certainty of evidence. We searched relevant databases and websites for published and unpublished trials until August 7, 2020. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial methodology. We included 33 randomized clinical trials enrolling a total of 13,312 participants. All trials were at overall high risk of bias. We identified one trial randomizing 6,425 participants to dexamethasone versus standard care. This trial showed evidence of a beneficial effect of dexamethasone on all-cause mortality (rate ratio 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75-0.93; p < 0.001; low certainty) and on mechanical ventilation (risk ratio [RR] 0.77; 95% CI 0.62-0.95; p = 0.021; low certainty). It was possible to perform meta-analysis of 10 comparisons. Meta-analysis showed no evidence of a difference between remdesivir versus placebo on all-cause mortality (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.40-1.37; p = 0.34, I2 = 58%; 2 trials; very low certainty) or nonserious adverse events (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.80-1.11; p = 0.48, I2 = 29%; 2 trials; low certainty). Meta-analysis showed evidence of a beneficial effect of remdesivir versus placebo on serious adverse events (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.63-0.94; p = 0.009, I2 = 0%; 2 trials; very low certainty) mainly driven by respiratory failure in one trial. Meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses showed that we could exclude the possibility that hydroxychloroquine versus standard care reduced the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.97-1.19; p = 0.17; I2 = 0%; 7 trials; low certainty) and serious adverse events (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.96-1.18; p = 0.21; I2 = 0%; 7 trials; low certainty) by 20% or more, and meta-analysis showed evidence of a harmful effect on nonserious adverse events (RR 2.40; 95% CI 2.01-2.87; p < 0.00001; I2 = 90%; 6 trials; very low certainty). Meta-analysis showed no evidence of a difference between lopinavir-ritonavir versus standard care on serious adverse events (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.39-1.04; p = 0.07, I2 = 0%; 2 trials; very low certainty) or nonserious adverse events (RR 1.14; 95% CI 0.85-1.53; p = 0.38, I2 = 75%; 2 trials; very low certainty). Meta-analysis showed no evidence of a difference between convalescent plasma versus standard care on all-cause mortality (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.33-1.10; p = 0.10, I2 = 0%; 2 trials; very low certainty). Five single trials showed statistically significant results but were underpowered to confirm or reject realistic intervention effects. None of the remaining trials showed evidence of a difference on our predefined outcomes. Because of the lack of relevant data, it was not possible to perform other meta-analyses, network meta-analysis, or individual patient data meta-analyses. The main limitation of this living review is the paucity of data currently available. Furthermore, the included trials were all at risks of systematic errors and random errors.\n\nOur results show that dexamethasone and remdesivir might be beneficial for COVID-19 patients, but the certainty of the evidence was low to very low, so more trials are needed. We can exclude the possibility of hydroxychloroquine versus standard care reducing the risk of death and serious adverse events by 20% or more. Otherwise, no evidence-based treatment for COVID-19 currently exists. This review will continuously inform best practice in treatment and clinical research of COVID-19.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pmed.1003293", "pmid": "32941437", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PMEDICINE-D-20-02447"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7498193"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-27T12:42:12.042Z", "modified": "2020-11-27T12:42:12.066Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "0210f1afaeb74e4d9082a7d9ba9f8162", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/0210f1afaeb74e4d9082a7d9ba9f8162.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/0210f1afaeb74e4d9082a7d9ba9f8162"}}, "title": "Population-level COVID-19 mortality risk for non-elderly individuals overall and for non-elderly individuals without underlying diseases in pandemic epicenters.", "authors": [{"family": "Ioannidis", "given": "John P A", "initials": "JPA"}, {"family": "Axfors", "given": "Cathrine", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Contopoulos-Ioannidis", "given": "Despina G", "initials": "DG"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-00", "journal": {"title": "Environ Res", "issn": "1096-0953", "issn-l": "0013-9351", "volume": "188", "issue": null, "pages": "109890"}, "abstract": "To provide estimates of the relative rate of COVID-19 death in people <65 years old versus older individuals in the general population, the absolute risk of COVID-19 death at the population level during the first epidemic wave, and the proportion of COVID-19 deaths in non-elderly people without underlying diseases in epicenters of the pandemic.\r\n\r\nCross-sectional survey of countries and US states with at least 800 COVID-19 deaths as of April 24, 2020 and with information on the number of deaths in people with age <65.

We conducted this survey to assess the methodological quality of registry protocols on potential treatments for COVID-19.\n\nClinical trial protocols were identified on the ClinicalTrials.gov and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry. Protocols were screened by two investigators independently against pre-defined eligibility criteria. Quality of the included protocols was assessed according to the modified 14-item SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) 2013 Statement.\n\nWe included 82 randomized controlled trial (RCT) protocols investigating treatment modalities for COVID-19. These ongoing trials are being conducted in 16 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities of China, and study interventions were either Western medicines (n = 56) or traditional Chinese medicine (n = 26). Findings of our quality assessment indicated that the existing trial protocols could be further improved on several aspects, including selection and definition of outcome measures, descriptions of study interventions and comparators, study subject recruitment time, definition of study inclusion and exclusion criteria, and allocation concealment methods. Descriptions of random sequence generation methodologies were accurate for the majority of included trial protocols (n = 64; 78.05%); however, reporting of allocation concealment remained unclear in 63 (76.83%) protocols. Therefore, the overall risk of selection bias across these RCTs was judged to be unclear. A total of 52 (63.41%) included RCT protocols were open-label trials and are thus associated with a high risk of performance bias and detection bias.\n\nQuality of currently available RCT protocols on the treatments for COVID-19 could be further improved. For transparency and effective knowledge translation in real-world clinically settings, it is important for trial investigators to standardize baseline treatments for patients with COVID-19 and assess clinically important core outcome measures.

The unpredictability of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) poses a major burden on health care and economic systems across the world. This is caused by the paucity of in-depth knowledge of the risk factors for severe COVID-19, insufficient diagnostic tools for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the absence of specific and effective drug treatments. While protective humoral and cellular immune responses are usually mounted against these betacoronaviruses, immune responses to SARS-CoV2 sometimes derail towards inflammatory tissue damage, leading to rapid admissions to intensive care units.

Alcohol now also poses specific concerns, such as increased risk of severe lung infections, domestic violence, child abuse, depression and suicide. Its use is unlikely to aid physical distancing or other preventative behavioural measures. Globally, alcohol contributes to 20% of injury and 11.5% of non-injury emergency room presentations. We provide some broad comparisons between alcohol-attributable and COVID-19-related hospitalisations and deaths in North America using most recent data. For example, for Canada in 2017 it was recently estimated there were 105 065 alcohol-attributable hospitalisations which represent a substantially higher rate over time than the 10 521 COVID-19 hospitalisations reported during the first 5 months of the pandemic. Despite the current importance of protecting health-care services, most governments have deemed alcohol sales to be as essential as food, fuel and pharmaceuticals. In many countries, alcohol is now more readily available and affordable than ever before, a situation global alcohol producers benefit from and have helped engineer. We argue that to protect frontline health-care services and public health more generally, it is essential that modest, evidence-based restrictions on alcohol prices, availability and marketing are introduced.

Natural killer (NK) cells are innate effector lymphocytes that respond to acute viral infections but might also contribute to immunopathology. Using 28-color flow cytometry, we here reveal strong NK cell activation across distinct subsets in peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients. This pattern was mirrored in scRNA-seq signatures of NK cells in bronchoalveolar lavage from COVID-19 patients. Unsupervised high-dimensional analysis of peripheral blood NK cells furthermore identified distinct NK cell immunotypes that were linked to disease severity.

Limited data are available for the cohort of pregnant women that gave rise to these hospitalized cases, hindering our ability to quantify risk of COVID-19 sequelae for pregnant women in the community.\r\n\r\nTo test the hypothesis that pregnant women in community differ in their COVID-19 symptoms profile and disease severity compared to non-pregnant women. This was assessed in two community-based cohorts of women aged 18-44 years in the United Kingdom, Sweden and the United States of America.\r\n\r\nThis observational study used prospectively collected longitudinal (smartphone application interface) and cross-sectional (web-based survey) data. Participants in the discovery cohort were drawn from 400,750 UK, Sweden and US women (79 pregnant who tested positive) who self-reported symptoms and events longitudinally via their smartphone, and a replication cohort drawn from 1,344,966 USA women (162 pregnant who tested positive) cross-sectional self-reports samples from the social media active user base. The study compared frequencies of symptoms and events, including self-reported SARS-CoV-2 testing and differences between pregnant and non-pregnant women who were hospitalized and those who recovered in the community.

Pregnant women were more likely to have received SARS-CoV-2 testing than non-pregnant, despite reporting fewer clinical symptoms. Pre-existing lung disease was most closely associated with the severity of symptoms in pregnant hospitalized women. Heart and kidney diseases and diabetes were additional factors of increased risk. The most frequent symptoms among all non-hospitalized women were anosmia [63% in pregnant, 92% in non-pregnant] and headache [72%, 62%]. Cardiopulmonary symptoms, including persistent cough [80%] and chest pain [73%], were more frequent among pregnant women who were hospitalized. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea and vomiting, were different among pregnant and non-pregnant women who developed severe outcomes.\r\n\r\nAlthough pregnancy is widely considered a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcomes, and was associated with higher propensity for testing, the profile of symptom characteristics and severity in our community-based cohorts were comparable to those observed among non-pregnant women, except for the gastrointestinal symptoms.

Aim: We used population data from Institut National D'\u00c9tudes D\u00e9mographiques on cumulative deaths due to COVID-19 from February to June 2020 in 10 European countries: Denmark, Norway, Sweden, The Netherlands, England & Wales, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal.

Methods: The relative risk of dying from COVID-19 was higher for men than for women in almost all age groups in all countries. The overall relative risk ranged from 1.11 (95% CI 1.01-1.23) in Portugal to 1.54 (95% CI 1.49-1.58) in France.

We identified a cluster of SARS-CoV-2 antivirals with characteristics of lysosomotropic agents, meaning that they are lipophilic weak bases capable of penetrating into cells. These agents include cepharentine, chloroquine, chlorpromazine, clemastine, cloperastine, emetine, hydroxychloroquine, haloperidol, ML240, PB28, ponatinib, siramesine, and zotatifin (eFT226) all of which are likely to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication by non-specific (off-target) effects, meaning that they probably do not act on their 'official' pharmacological targets, but rather interfere with viral replication through non-specific effects on acidophilic organelles including autophagosomes, endosomes, and lysosomes. Imatinib mesylate did not fall into this cluster.

Although displaying a wide variety of shapes and sizes, they are all composed of nucleic acid encapsulated into a protein capsid. After virions enter the host cell, they replicate to produce multiple copies of themselves. They then lyse the host, releasing virions to infect new cells. The high proliferation rate of viruses is the underlying cause of their fast transmission among living species. Although many viruses are harmless, some of them are responsible for severe diseases such as AIDS, viral hepatitis, and flu. Traditionally, electron microscopy is used to identify and characterize viruses. This approach is time- and labor-consuming, which is problematic upon pandemic proliferation of previously unknown viruses, such as H1N1 and COVID-19. Herein, we demonstrate a novel diagnosis approach for label-free identification and structural characterization of individual viruses that is based on a combination of nanoscale Raman and infrared spectroscopy. Using atomic force microscopy-infrared (AFM-IR) spectroscopy, we were able to probe structural organization of the virions of Herpes Simplex Type 1 viruses and bacteriophage MS2. We also showed that tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) could be used to reveal protein secondary structure and amino acid composition of the virus surface. Our results show that AFM-IR and TERS provide different but complementary information about the structure of complex biological specimens. This structural information can be used for fast and reliable identification of viruses.

Hyperinflammation and high levels of several cytokines, for example, IL-6, are observed in severe COVID-19 cases. However, little is known about the cellular origin of these cytokines. Here, we investigated whether circulating leukocytes from patients with COVID-19 had spontaneous cytokine production. Patients with hyperinflammatory COVID-19 (n = 6) and sepsis (n = 3) were included at Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital, Sweden. Healthy controls were also recruited (n = 5). Cytokines were measured in COVID-19 and sepsis patients using an Immulite immunoassay system. PBMCs were cultured with brefeldin A to allow cytokine accumulation. In parallel, LPS was used as an activator. Cells were analyzed for cytokines and surface markers by flow cytometry. High levels of IL-6 and measurable levels of IL-8 and TNF, but not IL-1\u03b2, were observed in COVID-19 patients. Monocytes from COVID-19 patients had spontaneous production of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 (P = 0.0043), but not of TNF and IL-6, compared to controls. No spontaneous cytokine production was seen in lymphocytes from either patients or controls. Activation with LPS resulted in massive cytokine production by monocytes from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, but not from sepsis patients. Finally, monocytes from COVID-19 patients produced more IL-1\u03b2 than from healthy controls (P = 0.0087) when activated. In conclusion, monocytes contribute partly to the ongoing hyperinflammation by production of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8. Additionally, they are responsive to further activation. This data supports the notion of IL-1\u03b2 blockade in treatment of COVID-19.

Here, we report discussions from the Isaac Newton Institute 'Models for an exit strategy' workshop (11-15 May 2020). A diverse community of modellers who are providing evidence to governments worldwide were asked to identify the main questions that, if answered, would allow for more accurate predictions of the effects of different exit strategies. Based on these questions, we propose a roadmap to facilitate the development of reliable models to guide exit strategies. This roadmap requires a global collaborative effort from the scientific community and policymakers, and has three parts: (i) improve estimation of key epidemiological parameters; (ii) understand sources of heterogeneity in populations; and (iii) focus on requirements for data collection, particularly in low-to-middle-income countries.

Initial data suggest that overall, pregnancy is not a significant risk factor for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, case series have suggested that maternal obesity is one of the most important comorbidities associated with more severe disease. In obese individuals, suppressors of cytokine signaling are upregulated and type I and III interferon responses are delayed and blunted leading to ineffective viral clearance. Obesity is also associated with changes in systemic immunity involving a wide range of immune cells and mechanisms that lead to low-grade chronic inflammation, which can compromise antiviral immunity. Macrophage activation in adipose tissue can produce low levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6). Further, adipocyte secretion of leptin is pro-inflammatory and high circulating levels of leptin have been associated with mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. The synergistic effects of obesity-associated delays in immune control of COVID-19 with mechanical stress of increased adipose tissue may contribute to a greater risk of pulmonary compromise in obese pregnant women. In this review, we bring together data regarding obesity as a key co-morbidity for COVID-19 in pregnancy with known changes in the antiviral immune response associated with obesity.

As a key to tracing the disease and to implement strategies aimed at breaking the chain of disease transmission, extensive testing for SARS-CoV-2 was suggested. Although nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs are the most commonly used biological samples for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, they have a number of limitations related to sample collection and healthcare personnel safety. In this context, saliva is emerging as a promising alternative to nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 diagnosis and monitoring. Saliva collection, being a non-invasive approach with possibility for self-collection, circumvents to a great extent the limitations associated with the use of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs. In addition, various salivary biomarkers including the salivary metabolomics offer a high promise to be useful for better understanding of COVID-19 and possibly in the identification of patients with various degrees of severity, including asymptomatic carriers. This review summarises the clinical and scientific basis for the potential use of saliva for COVID-19 diagnosis and disease monitoring.

These include both the course and treatment of diseases. It is becoming increasingly clear that infections with SARS-CoV-2 can cause considerable immunological alterations, which particularly also affect pathogenetically and/or therapeutically relevant factors. Against this background we summarize here the current state of knowledge on the interaction of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 with mediators of the acute phase of inflammation (TNF, IL-1, IL-6), type 1 and type 17 immune responses (IL-12, IL-23, IL-17, IL-36), type 2 immune reactions (IL-4, IL-13, IL-5, IL-31, IgE), B-cell immunity, checkpoint regulators (PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA4), and orally druggable signaling pathways (JAK, PDE4, calcineurin). In addition, we discuss in this context non-specific immune modulation by glucocorticosteroids, methotrexate, antimalarial drugs, azathioprine, dapsone, mycophenolate mofetil and fumaric acid esters, as well as neutrophil granulocyte-mediated innate immune mechanisms. From these recent findings we derive possible implications for the therapeutic modulation of said immunological mechanisms in connection with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Although, of course, the greatest care should be taken with patients with immunologically mediated diseases or immunomodulating therapies, it appears that many treatments can also be carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic; some even appear to alleviate COVID-19.", "doi": "10.1111/ddg.14169", "pmid": "32761894", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7436872"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-26T12:16:43.799Z", "modified": "2020-11-30T08:42:56.759Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "5b8ec62501cf41da8f6c8fdc9837a030", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/5b8ec62501cf41da8f6c8fdc9837a030.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/5b8ec62501cf41da8f6c8fdc9837a030"}}, "title": "Markers of NETosis and DAMPs are altered in critically ill COVID-19 patients", "authors": [{"family": "Huckriede", "given": "Joram", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Anderberg", "given": "Sara B\u00fclow", "initials": "SB"}, {"family": "Morales", "given": "Albert", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Vries", "given": "Femke de", "initials": "Fd"}, {"family": "Hultstr\u00f6m", "given": "Michael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Bergqvist", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Ortiz", "given": "Jos\u00e9 T", "initials": "JT"}, {"family": "Sels", "given": "Jan Willem", "initials": "JW"}, {"family": "Wichapong", "given": "Kanin", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Lipcsey", "given": "Miklos", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Poll", "given": "Marcel van de", "initials": "Mvd"}, {"family": "Larsson", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Luther", "given": "Tomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Reutelingsperger", "given": "Chris", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Frutos", "given": "Pablo Garcia de", "initials": "PGd"}, {"family": "Frithiof", "given": "Robert", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Nicolaes", "given": "Gerry A F", "initials": "GAF"}], "type": "posted-content", "published": "2020-08-05", "journal": {"title": "Research square", "issn": null, "issn-l": null, "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.21203/rs.3.rs-52432/v1", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Research Area: Biobanks for COVID-19 research": null, "Funder: KAW/SciLifeLab": null, "Type: Preprint": null, "Funder: VR": null, "Category: Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "NA", "key": "Available on request", "description": null}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-01-04T09:26:11.519Z", "modified": "2021-05-06T05:36:02.665Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "37c9a6ce93fa4bbba28a966ae11c4157", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/37c9a6ce93fa4bbba28a966ae11c4157.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/37c9a6ce93fa4bbba28a966ae11c4157"}}, "title": "High seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in elderly care employees in Sweden.", "authors": [{"family": "Lindahl", "given": "Johanna F", "initials": "JF"}, {"family": "Hoffman", "given": "Tove", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Esmaeilzadeh", "given": "Mouna", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Olsen", "given": "Bj\u00f6rn", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Winter", "given": "Reidar", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Amer", "given": "Stefan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Moln\u00e1r", "given": "Christian", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Svalberg", "given": "Ann", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Lundkvist", "given": "\u00c5ke", "initials": "\u00c5"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-08-05", "journal": {"title": "Infect Ecol Epidemiol", "issn": "2000-8686", "issn-l": "2000-8686", "volume": "10", "issue": "1", "pages": "1789036"}, "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic is growing and spread in the Swedish elderly care system during April 2020.

We find that firms with higher carbon intensities experienced significantly large decreases in stock values particularly those within the crude petroleum extraction, air transport and coke and refined petroleum industries. Our tentative conclusion is that efforts to revitalize the economy should avoid subsidizing stranded assets and instead target the industries of the future.

The effectiveness of the lockdown has not been precisely assessed with respect to the intensity of mobility restriction and the time until the outbreak receded.\r\n\r\nWe used processed mobile phone tracking data to measure mobility restriction, and related those data to the number of new SARS-CoV-2 positive cases detected on a daily base in the three most affected Italian regions, Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna, from February 1 through April 6, 2020, when two subsequent lockdowns with increasing intensity were implemented by the Italian government.\r\n\r\nDuring the study period, mobility restriction was inversely related to the daily number of newly diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 positive cases only after the second, more effective lockdown, with a peak in the curve of diagnosed cases of infection occurring 14 to 18 days from lockdown in the three regions and 9 to 25 days in the included provinces. An effective reduction in transmission must have occurred nearly immediately after the tighter lockdown, given the lag time of around 10 days from asymptomatic infection to diagnosis.

In this paper, we summarize what is known about the stress-sleep link and confinement as well as effective insomnia treatment. We discuss those effects of the current home confinement situation that can disrupt sleep but also those that could benefit sleep quality. We suggest adaptions of cognitive behavioural therapy elements that are feasible to implement for those facing changed work schedules and requirements, those with health anxiety and those handling childcare and home-schooling, whilst also recognizing the general limitations imposed on physical exercise and social interaction.

The European and African Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association (E-AHPBA), the premier representative body for practicing HPB surgeons in Europe and Africa, conducted this survey to assess the impact of COVID-19 on HPB surgery.\n\nAn online survey was disseminated to all E-AHPBA members to assess the effects of the pandemic on unit capacity, management of HPB cancers, use of COVID-19 screening and other aspects of service delivery.\n\nOverall, 145 (25%) members responded. Most units, particularly in COVID-high countries (>100,000 cases) reported insufficient critical care capacity and reduced HPB operating sessions compared to COVID-low countries. Delayed access to cancer surgery necessitated alternatives including increased neoadjuvant chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer and colorectal liver metastases, and locoregional treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma. Other aspects of service delivery including COVID-19 screening and personal protective equipment varied between units and countries.\n\nThis study demonstrates that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound adverse impact on the delivery of HPB cancer care across the continents of Europe and Africa.

Some cases rapidly develop deteriorating lung function, which causes deep hypoxaemia and requires urgent treatment. Many centres have started treating patients in the prone position, and oxygenation has improved considerably in some cases. Questions have been raised regarding the mechanisms behind this. The mini review provides some insights into the role of supine and prone body positions and summarises the latest understanding of the responsible mechanisms. The scope for discussion is outside the neonatal period and entirely based on experimental and clinical experiences related to adults. The human respiratory system is a complex interplay of many different variables. Therefore, this mini review has prioritised previous and ongoing research to find explanations based on three scientific areas: gravity, lung structure and fractal geometry and vascular regulation. It concludes that gravity is one of the variables responsible for ventilation/perfusion matching but in concert with lung structure and fractal geometry, ventilation and regulation of lung vascular tone. Since ventilation distribution does not change between supine and prone positions, the higher expression of nitric oxide in dorsal lung vessels than in ventral vessels is likely to be the most important mechanism behind enhanced oxygenation in the prone position.", "doi": "10.1111/apa.15382", "pmid": "32484966", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7301016"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-25T08:08:41.192Z", "modified": "2020-11-30T09:02:31.821Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "666b3cf7632f4444bc8e1b4aab6b02b4", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/666b3cf7632f4444bc8e1b4aab6b02b4.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/666b3cf7632f4444bc8e1b4aab6b02b4"}}, "title": "Global Survey on Pancreatic Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic.", "authors": [{"family": "Oba", "given": "Atsushi", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Stoop", "given": "Thomas F", "initials": "TF"}, {"family": "L\u00f6hr", "given": "Matthias", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Hackert", "given": "Thilo", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Zyromski", "given": "Nicholas", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Nealon", "given": "William H", "initials": "WH"}, {"family": "Unno", "given": "Michiaki", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Schulick", "given": "Richard D", "initials": "RD"}, {"family": "Al-Musawi", "given": "Mohammed H", "initials": "MH"}, {"family": "Wu", "given": "Wenming", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Zhao", "given": "Yupei", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Satoi", "given": "Sohei", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Wolfgang", "given": "Christopher L", "initials": "CL"}, {"family": "Abu Hilal", "given": "Mohammad", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Besselink", "given": "Marc G", "initials": "MG"}, {"family": "Del Chiaro", "given": "Marco", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Pancreas Club, European Pancreatic Club, Chinese Pancreatic Surgery Association, European Consortium on Minimally Invasive Pancreatic Surgery, Study Group of Preoperative Therapy for Pancreatic Cancer, Study Group of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma with Peritoneal Metastasis and International Study Group on Cystic Tumors of the Pancreas", "given": "", "initials": ""}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-08-00", "journal": {"title": "Ann Surg", "issn": "1528-1140", "volume": "272", "issue": "2", "pages": "e87-e93", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "The aim of this study was to clarify the role of pancreatic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic to optimize patients' and clinicians' safety and safeguard health care capacity.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic heavily impacts health care systems worldwide.

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, causing COVID-19, a respiratory disease presenting with fever, cough, and often pneumonia. WHO has set the strategic objective to interrupt spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. An outbreak in Bavaria, Germany, starting at the end of January, 2020, provided the opportunity to study transmission events, incubation period, and secondary attack rates.\n\nA case was defined as a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR. Case interviews were done to describe timing of onset and nature of symptoms and to identify and classify contacts as high risk (had cumulative face-to-face contact with a confirmed case for \u226515 min, direct contact with secretions or body fluids of a patient with confirmed COVID-19, or, in the case of health-care workers, had worked within 2 m of a patient with confirmed COVID-19 without personal protective equipment) or low risk (all other contacts). High-risk contacts were ordered to stay at home in quarantine for 14 days and were actively followed up and monitored for symptoms, and low-risk contacts were tested upon self-reporting of symptoms. We defined fever and cough as specific symptoms, and defined a prodromal phase as the presence of non-specific symptoms for at least 1 day before the onset of specific symptoms. Whole genome sequencing was used to confirm epidemiological links and clarify transmission events where contact histories were ambiguous; integration with epidemiological data enabled precise reconstruction of exposure events and incubation periods. Secondary attack rates were calculated as the number of cases divided by the number of contacts, using Fisher's exact test for the 95% CIs.\n\nPatient 0 was a Chinese resident who visited Germany for professional reasons. 16 subsequent cases, often with mild and non-specific symptoms, emerged in four transmission generations. Signature mutations in the viral genome occurred upon foundation of generation 2, as well as in one case pertaining to generation 4. The median incubation period was 4\u00b70 days (IQR 2\u00b73-4\u00b73) and the median serial interval was 4\u00b70 days (3\u00b70-5\u00b70). Transmission events were likely to have occurred presymptomatically for one case (possibly five more), at the day of symptom onset for four cases (possibly five more), and the remainder after the day of symptom onset or unknown. One or two cases resulted from contact with a case during the prodromal phase. Secondary attack rates were 75\u00b70% (95% CI 19\u00b70-99\u00b70; three of four people) among members of a household cluster in common isolation, 10\u00b70% (1\u00b72-32\u00b70; two of 20) among household contacts only together until isolation of the patient, and 5\u00b71% (2\u00b76-8\u00b79; 11 of 217) among non-household, high-risk contacts.\n\nAlthough patients in our study presented with predominately mild, non-specific symptoms, infectiousness before or on the day of symptom onset was substantial. Additionally, the incubation period was often very short and false-negative tests occurred. These results suggest that although the outbreak was controlled, successful long-term and global containment of COVID-19 could be difficult to achieve.\n\nAll authors are employed and all expenses covered by governmental, federal state, or other publicly funded institutions.", "doi": "10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30314-5", "pmid": "32422201", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "URL", "key": "https://www.thelancet.com/action/showFullTableHTML?isHtml=true&tableId=tbl1&pii=S1473-3099%2820%2930314-5", "description": "Characteristics of 16 laboratory-confirmed cases from in January\u2013February, 2020"}, {"db": "URL", "key": "https://www.thelancet.com/action/showFullTableHTML?isHtml=true&tableId=tbl2&pii=S1473-3099%2820%2930314-5", "description": "Genome single nucleotide polymorphisms for 13 laboratory-confirmed cases from in January\u2013February, 2020"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-10T08:57:10.569Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:45:47.903Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "19e27f15f057496f97f18f9b6d599e2e", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/19e27f15f057496f97f18f9b6d599e2e.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/19e27f15f057496f97f18f9b6d599e2e"}}, "title": "Geographical and temporal distribution of SARS-CoV-2 clades in the WHO European Region, January to June 2020.", "authors": [{"family": "Alm", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Broberg", "given": "Eeva K", "initials": "EK"}, {"family": "Connor", "given": "Thomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Hodcroft", "given": "Emma B", "initials": "EB"}, {"family": "Komissarov", "given": "Andrey B", "initials": "AB"}, {"family": "Maurer-Stroh", "given": "Sebastian", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Melidou", "given": "Angeliki", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Neher", "given": "Richard A", "initials": "RA"}, {"family": "O'Toole", "given": "\u00c1ine", "initials": "\u00c1"}, {"family": "Pereyaslov", "given": "Dmitriy", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "WHO European Region sequencing laboratories and GISAID EpiCoV group", "given": "", "initials": ""}, {"family": "WHO European Region sequencing laboratories and GISAID EpiCoV group*", "given": "", "initials": ""}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-08-00", "journal": {"title": "Euro Surveill", "issn": "1560-7917", "volume": "25", "issue": "32", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "We show the distribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) genetic clades over time and between countries and outline potential genomic surveillance objectives.

of people dying from COVID-19 are reported, but data are lacking on the way they die. Background: To study symptoms and symptom relief during the last week of life, comparing nursing homes with hospitals. Objective: The Swedish Register of Palliative Care with national coverage was used. Breakthrough symptoms were registered as Yes/No. Symptom relief was recorded on a 3-grade scale as Design: complete-partial-no relief. All deaths in COVID-19 were contrasted to deaths in a reference population (deaths 2019). Deaths at nursing homes were compared with deaths in hospitals. All deaths in hospitals or nursing homes (Setting and Subjects: n = 490) were analyzed. Deaths in other settings (specialized palliative care wards [n = 11], in palliative home care [n = 2], or in their own homes [n = 8]) were excluded (n = 21). Only patients with expected deaths (n = 390) were entered in the final analysis. Breathlessness as a breakthrough symptom was more common in COVID-19 patients than in the 2019 reference population (Results: p < 0.001) and relief of breathlessness, as well as anxiety, delirium, and death rattles was less successful in COVID-19 patients (p < 0.05 to p < 0.01 in different comparisons). Patients were older in nursing homes than in hospitals (86.6 years vs. 80.9 years, p < 0.001) and more often female (48% vs. 34%, p < 0.001). Breakthrough of breathlessness was much more frequently reported in hospital settings than in nursing homes, 73% versus 35% (p < 0.0001), and complete relief was more rarely possible in hospitals, 20% versus 42% (p < 0.01). The proportion of partial relief+complete relief was comparable, 92% versus 95% (ns). Also, anxiety and pain were more often completely relieved in nursing homes (p < 0.01 in both comparisons). The lower symptom prevalence in nursing homes may be explained by elderly frail residents dying already in the first phase of the COVID-19 disease, before acute respiratory distress syndrome develops.Conclusion:", "doi": "10.1089/jpm.2020.0249", "pmid": "32746685", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Other": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-07T16:02:24.617Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:46:12.930Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "b4d9a71a5e6d4e88930986beffc8b7d8", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/b4d9a71a5e6d4e88930986beffc8b7d8.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/b4d9a71a5e6d4e88930986beffc8b7d8"}}, "title": "Efficacy and tolerability of bevacizumab in patients with severe Covid -19", "authors": [{"family": "Pang", "given": "Jiaojiao", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Xu", "given": "Feng", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Aondio", "given": "Gianmarco", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Li", "given": "Yu", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Fumagalli", "given": "Alberto", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Lu", "given": "Ming", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Valmadre", "given": "Giuseppe", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Wei", "given": "Jie", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Bian", "given": "Yuan", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Canesi", "given": "Margherita", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Damiani", "given": "Giovanni", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Zhang", "given": "Yuan", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Yu", "given": "Dexin", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Chen", "given": "Jun", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Ji", "given": "Xiang", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "Sui", "given": "Wenhai", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Wang", "given": "Bailu", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Wu", "given": "Shuo", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Kovacs", "given": "Attila", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Revera", "given": "Miriam", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Wang", "given": "Hao", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Zhang", "given": "Ying", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Chen", "given": "Yuguo", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Cao", "given": "Yihai", "initials": "Y"}], "type": "posted-content", "published": "2020-07-29", "journal": {"title": "Nat Commun", "issn": "2041-1723", "issn-l": "2041-1723", "volume": "12", "issue": "1", "pages": "814"}, "abstract": "On the basis of Covid-19-induced pulmonary pathological and vascular changes, we hypothesize that the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drug bevacizumab might be beneficial for treating Covid-19 patients.

Followed up for 28 days. Among these, bevacizumab plus standard care markedly improves the PaO2/FiO2 ratios at days 1 and 7. By day 28, 24 (92%) patients show improvement in oxygen-support status, 17 (65%) patients are discharged, and none show worsen oxygen-support status nor die. Significant reduction of lesion areas/ratios are shown in chest computed tomography (CT) or X-ray within 7 days. Of 14 patients with fever, body temperature normalizes within 72 h in 13 (93%) patients. Relative to comparable controls, bevacizumab shows clinical efficacy by improving oxygenation and shortening oxygen-support duration.

triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the scientific community made a huge effort to provide an immediate response to the challenges posed by Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). One of the most important proteins of the virus is an enzyme, called 3CLpro or main protease, already identified as an important pharmacological target also in SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS) viruses. This protein triggers the production of a whole series of enzymes necessary for the virus to carry out its replicating and infectious activities. Therefore, it is crucial to gain a deeper understanding of 3CLpro structure and function in order to effectively target this enzyme. All-atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to examine the different conformational behaviors of the monomeric and dimeric form of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro apo structure, as revealed by microsecond time scale MD simulations.

However, a meta-analysis on the efficacy of steroids in treating these coronavirus infections is lacking. (2) Purpose: We assessed a methodological criticism on the quality of previous published meta-analyses and the risk of misleading conclusions with important therapeutic consequences. We also examined the evidence of the efficacy of corticosteroids in reducing mortality in SARS, MERS and COVID-19. (3) Methods: PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were used to identify studies published until 25 April 2020, that reported associations between steroid use and mortality in treating SARS/MERS/COVID-19. Two investigators screened and extracted data independently. Searches were restricted to studies on humans, and articles that did not report the exact number of patients in each group or data on mortality were excluded. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) or hazard ratios (HRs) under the fixed- and random-effect model. (4) Results: Eight articles (4051 patients) were eligible for inclusion. Among these selected studies, 3416 patients were diagnosed with SARS, 360 patients with MERS, and 275 with COVID-19; 60.3% patients were administered steroids. The meta-analyses including all studies showed no differences overall in terms of mortality (OR 1.152, 95% CI 0.631-2.101 in the random effects model, p = 0.645). However, this conclusion might be biased, because, in some studies, the patients in the steroid group had more severe symptoms than those in the control group. In contrast, when the meta-analysis was performed restricting only to studies that used appropriate adjustment (e.g., time, disease severity), there was a significant difference between the two groups (HR 0.378, 95% CI 0.221-0.646 in the random effects model, p < 0.0001). Although there was no difference in mortality when steroids were used in severe cases, there was a difference among the group with more underlying diseases (OR 3.133, 95% CI 1.670-5.877, p < 0.001). (5) Conclusions: To our knowledge, this study is the first comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis providing the most accurate evidence on the effect of steroids in coronavirus infections. If not contraindicated, and in the absence of side effects, the use of steroids should be considered in coronavirus infection including COVID-19.", "doi": "10.3390/jcm9082392", "pmid": "32726951", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "jcm9082392"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7465945"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-26T12:15:27.760Z", "modified": "2020-11-30T08:44:13.309Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "d94b8fd3ab114fbab0ca35902c0364b3", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/d94b8fd3ab114fbab0ca35902c0364b3.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/d94b8fd3ab114fbab0ca35902c0364b3"}}, "title": "Compliance to Recommendations and Mental Health Consequences among Elderly in Sweden during the Initial Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic-A Cross Sectional Online Survey.", "authors": [{"family": "Gustavsson", "given": "Johanna", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Beckman", "given": "Linda", "initials": "L"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-07-26", "journal": {"title": "Int J Environ Res Public Health", "issn": "1660-4601", "volume": "17", "issue": "15", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Background (1): In the wake of COVID-19, elderly people have been labelled a risk group.

Participants rated the implementation highly in terms of length, ability for discussion, satisfaction, applicability to professional practice, and expertise of discussants (median scores: 4, 4, 4, 4 and 5 out of 5).\n\nVirtual learning has dominated the education landscape during COVID-19 pandemic, but few data are available on its effectiveness. This study demonstrated feasibility of virtual learning for disseminating best practices in tracheostomy, engaging a diverse, multidisciplinary audience. Learning of complex technical skills proved a hurdle, however, suggesting need for hands-on experience for technical mastery. While interactive videoconferencing via webinar affords an engaging and scalable strategy for sharing knowledge, further investigation is needed on clinical outcomes to define effective strategies for experiential online learning and virtual in-service simulations.", "doi": "10.1177/0003489420941542", "pmid": "32680435", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7369399"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-07T16:32:06.801Z", "modified": "2020-12-07T16:33:54.718Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "c23bcab33a00461ca27d92a08ead96cf", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/c23bcab33a00461ca27d92a08ead96cf.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/c23bcab33a00461ca27d92a08ead96cf"}}, "title": "Repurposing CD8 + T cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2 for cancer immunotherapy: a positive aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic?", "authors": [{"family": "Gujar", "given": "Shashi", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Pol", "given": "Jonathan G", "initials": "JG"}, {"family": "Kim", "given": "Youra", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Kroemer", "given": "Guido", "initials": "G"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-07-16", "journal": {"title": "Oncoimmunology", "issn": "2162-4011", "volume": "9", "issue": "1", "pages": "1794424", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has afflicted most countries on the planet.

The attack rate was highest in Luxembourg followed by Italy and Switzerland. There was a significant (p = 0.02) correlation between decreased attack rate and increased environmental temperature. The case fatality rate was highest in Italy followed by Iran and Spain. There was no significant correlation between the case fatality rate and temperature. This study indicates that lower temperature may increase SARS-CoV-2 transmission (measured as an increased attack rate), but there is no evidence that temperature affects the severity of the disease (measured as case fatality rate).

coronavirus (CoV) infection (after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) caused by a novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) of the genus Beta-coronavirus has become a global pandemic. CoVs are enveloped viruses whose proteins include spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E) which are embedded in the viral envelope. The glycosylated S protein, which forms homo-trimeric spikes on the surface of the viral particle, mediates viral entry into host cells. SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV, uses the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell surface protein for cellular entry. An attractive anti-viral approach is targeting virus entry into cells, for which three strategies are suggested: 1) direct targeting of the viral glycoprotein; 2) targeting the viral receptor on the cell surface; and 3) using soluble (s) ACE2 that binds to S protein thereby neutralizing the virus. In this article, the advantages and disadvantages of these strategies are explained. Moreover, we propose that fusion of the sACE2 to anti-CD16 to produce a bi-speci\ufb01c molecule could be a promising anti-viral strategy.", "doi": "10.1080/21645515.2020.1787066", "pmid": "32663051", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-08T10:42:25.787Z", "modified": "2020-12-08T10:42:53.471Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "097a76b78d194ee4b04ef819bfdb543c", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/097a76b78d194ee4b04ef819bfdb543c.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/097a76b78d194ee4b04ef819bfdb543c"}}, "title": "Misinformation and de-contextualization: international media reporting on Sweden and COVID-19.", "authors": [{"family": "Irwin", "given": "Rachel Elisabeth", "initials": "RE"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-07-13", "journal": {"title": "Global Health", "issn": "1744-8603", "volume": "16", "issue": "1", "pages": "62", "issn-l": "1744-8603"}, "abstract": "In the first month of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, Sweden took the same strategy as most other countries, working to \"flatten the curve,\" by slowing transmission so that the healthcare system could cope with the disease. However, unlike most other countries, much of Sweden's implementation focused on voluntary and stepwise action, rather than legislation and compulsory measures, leading to considerable attention in the international media.Six main narratives emerged in the international media reporting on Sweden during the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) Life is normal in Sweden, (2) Sweden has a herd immunity strategy, (3) Sweden is not following expert advice, (4) Sweden is not following WHO recommendations (5) the Swedish approach is failing and (6) Swedes trust the government. While these narratives are partially grounded in reality, in some media outlets, the language and examples used to frame the story distorted the accuracy of the reporting.This debate examines the ways in which international media both constructs and represents a pandemic, and the implications for how researchers engage with news and social media. Cross-country comparison and the sharing of best practice are reliant on accurate information.

Early prediction of survival of hospitalized patients will help the clinical management of COVID-19, but such a prediction model which is reliable and valid is still lacking.\n\nWe retrospectively enrolled 628 confirmed cases of COVID-19 using positive RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 in Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. These patients were randomly grouped into a training cohort (60%) and a validation cohort (40%). In the training cohort, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis and multivariate Cox regression analysis were utilized to identify prognostic factors for in-hospital survival of patients with COVID-19. A nomogram based on the three variables was built for clinical use. Areas under the ROC curves (AUC), concordance index (C-index) and calibration curve were used to evaluate the efficiency of the nomogram in both the training and validation cohorts.\n\nHypertension, higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and increased NT-proBNP value were found to be significantly associated with poorer prognosis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The three predictors were further used to build a prediction nomogram. The C-index of the nomogram in the training and validation cohorts was 0.901 and 0.892, respectively. The AUC in the training cohort was 0.922 for 14- day and 0.919 for 21-day probability of in-hospital survival, while in the validation cohort was 0.922 and 0.881, respectively. Moreover, the calibration curve for 14- day and 21-day survival also showed high coherence between the predicted and actual probability of survival.\n\nWe managed to build a predictive model and constructed a nomogram for predicting in-hospital survival of patients with COVID-19.

To promote capacity building, ESTSS offers a certification programme based on a curriculum in psychotraumatology and corresponding on-line training to the European community of mental health professionals. To assure evidence-based approaches and methods tailored to current circumstances, ESTSS has initiated a pan-European research project with international cooperation aimed at studying the mental health consequences of the pandemic, with a focus on psychological trauma and other stress-related reactions.

In this preclinical study, we investigated whether the combination of HCQ+AZI would be compatible with the therapeutic induction of anticancer immune responses. For this, we used doses of HCQ and AZI that affect whole-body physiology (as indicated by a partial blockade in cardiac and hepatic autophagic flux for HCQ and a reduction in body weight for AZI), showing that their combined administration did not interfere with tumor growth control induced by the immunogenic cell death inducer oxaliplatin. Moreover, the HCQ+AZI combination did not affect the capacity of a curative regimen (cisplatin + crizotinib + PD-1 blockade) to eradicate established orthotopic lung cancers in mice.

The main aim of this study was to evaluate the mutual effects of belief that the pandemic was the result of a conspiracy on knowledge and anxiety levels among students at the University of Jordan (UJ). An electronic-based survey was conducted between 29 March, 2020 and 31 March, 2020. The targeted population involved all undergraduate and postgraduate students from the health, scientific and humanities schools at UJ. Survey sections included 26 items on: socio-demographic information, knowledge and sources of information about the disease, attitude towards the false notion that COVID-19 stemmed from a conspiracy and items to assess the anxiety level among students during the quarantine period. The total number of participants was 1540 students. The mean age of study participants was 22 years and females predominated the study population (n = 1145, 74.4%). The majority of participants perceived the disease as moderately dangerous (n = 1079, 70.1%). Males, Jordanians and participants with lower income were more inclined to feel that COVID-19 is very dangerous. A lower level of knowledge and a higher level of anxiety about COVID-19 were associated with the belief that the disease is part of a conspiracy. Females and participants with lower income were more likely to believe that the disease is related to conspiracy. Belief in conspiracy regarding the origin of COVID-19 was associated with misinformation about the availability of a vaccine and the therapeutic use of antibiotics for COVID-19 treatment. The Ministry of Health in Jordan was the most common source of information about COVID-19 reported by the participants (n = 1018). The false belief that COVID-19 was the result of a global conspiracy could be the consequence of a lower level of knowledge about the virus and could lead to a higher level of anxiety, which should be considered in the awareness tools of various media platforms about the current pandemic.", "doi": "10.3390/ijerph17144915", "pmid": "32650409", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "ijerph17144915"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7399915"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-08T14:17:45.329Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:46:13.181Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "6530aa23a91f405dab1dffe84e6082a7", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/6530aa23a91f405dab1dffe84e6082a7.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/6530aa23a91f405dab1dffe84e6082a7"}}, "title": "Female Faculty: Why So Few and Why Care?", "authors": [{"family": "Kamerlin", "given": "Shina Caroline Lynn", "initials": "SCL"}, {"family": "Wittung-Stafshede", "given": "Pernilla", "initials": "P"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-07-08", "journal": {"title": "Chemistry", "issn": "1521-3765", "volume": "26", "issue": "38", "pages": "8319-8323", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Despite slow ongoing progress in increasing the representation of women in academia, women remain significantly under-represented at senior levels, in particular in the natural sciences and engineering.

In order to investigate the relation of inflammation and the influence of coagulation factors on their release, human peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMCs) were treated with autologous serum, heparinized plasma and different doses of fibrin. Thereafter, the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the secretome of PBMCs was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

We established a translational approach combining home blood sampling by finger-pricking with multiplexed serology to assess the exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a general population. The developed procedure determines the immune response in multiplexed assays against several spike (S, here denoted SPK), receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid (NCP) proteins in eluates from dried capillary blood. The seroprevalence was then determined in two study sets by mailing 1000 blood sampling kits to random households in urban Stockholm during early and late April 2020, respectively. After receiving 55% (1097/2000) of the cards back within three weeks, 80% (878/1097) were suitable for the analyses of IgG and IgM titers. The data revealed diverse pattern of immune response, thus seroprevalence was dependent on the antigen, immunoglobulin class, stringency to include different antigens, as well as the required analytical performance. Applying unsupervised dimensionality reduction to the combined IgG and IgM data, 4.4% (19/435; 95% CI: 2.4%-6.3%) and 6.3% (28/443; 95% CI: 4.1%-8.6%) of the samples clustered with convalescent controls. Using overlapping scores from at least two SPK antigens, prevalence rates reached 10.1% (44/435; 95% CI: 7.3%-12.9%) in study set 1 and 10.8% (48/443; 95% CI: 7.9%-13.7%). Measuring the immune response against several SARS-CoV-2 proteins in a multiplexed workflow can provide valuable insights about the serological diversity and improve the certainty of the classification.

In advance of effective antiviral therapies, countries have applied different public-health strategies to control spread and manage healthcare need. Sweden has taken a unique approach of not implementing strict closures, instead urging personal responsibility. We analyze the results of this and other potential strategies for pandemic control in Sweden.\n\nWe implemented individual-based modeling of COVID-19 spread in Sweden using population, employment, and household data. Epidemiological parameters for COVID-19 were validated on a limited date range; where substantial uncertainties remained, multiple parameters were tested. The effects of different public-health strategies were tested over a 160-day period, analyzed for their effects on ICU demand and death rate, and compared to Swedish data for April 2020.\n\nSwedish mortality rates fall intermediate between European countries that quickly imposed stringent public-health controls and countries that acted later. Models most closely reproducing reported mortality data suggest large portions of the population voluntarily self-isolate. Swedish ICU utilization rates remained lower than predicted, but a large fraction of deaths occurred in non-ICU patients. This suggests that patient prognosis was considered in ICU admission, reducing healthcare load at a cost of decreased survival in patients not admitted.\n\nThe Swedish COVID-19 strategy has thus far yielded a striking result: mild mandates overlaid with voluntary measures can achieve results highly similar to late-onset stringent mandates.

In Iran, it has caused around 197,000 inflictions and 9200 deaths up to June 18, 2020. While many departments turned to telehealth in this era, the trauma service should provide non-stop in presence service to the trauma victims. Our trauma center is the largest in the southwest of Iran, with the mean annual admission of 18,500 polytrauma patients. In this center, we designed a safety protocol to mitigate the spread of disease and also have a more robust case finding system, especially among asymptomatic carriers who attend hospitals based on their trauma. In brief, all unstable patients were considered SARS-COV-2 positive and were directed toward the Specialized COVID-19 related ICU. For all stable patients, history, physical examination, CXR, and lab test (Complete Blood Count, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate, C-Reactive Protein) were ordered before entering the wards. If there was any suspicion of COVID-19, the stable patient was admitted to the COVID-19 specialized ward. Among all 1805 patients admitted during a ten weeks interval (from January 30, 2020, to April 14, 2020), 84 had a red flag and toward to COVID-19 related wards. Of those, 67 had positive PCR or evidence in CT in favor of the COOVID-19. Moreover, during regular workups, we found that 19 completely asymptomatic trauma victims had typical Chest CT scan findings of COVID-19.", "doi": "10.30476/BEAT.2020.87029", "pmid": "32944581",

While genetically distinct, SARS-CoV-1, the aetiological agent responsible for an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003, utilises the same host cell receptor as SARS-CoV-2 for entry: angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Parts of the SARS-CoV-1 spike glycoprotein (S protein), which interacts with ACE2, appear conserved in SARS-CoV-2.AimThe cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) previously generated against the S protein of SARS-CoV-1 was assessed.MethodsThe SARS-CoV-2 S protein sequence was aligned to those of SARS-CoV-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and common-cold coronaviruses. Abilities of mAbs generated against SARS-CoV-1 S protein to bind SARS-CoV-2 or its S protein were tested with SARS-CoV-2 infected cells as well as cells expressing either the full length protein or a fragment of its S2 subunit. Quantitative ELISA was also performed to compare binding of mAbs to recombinant S protein.ResultsAn immunogenic domain in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-1 S protein is highly conserved in SARS-CoV-2 but not in MERS and human common-cold coronaviruses. Four murine mAbs raised against this immunogenic fragment could recognise SARS-CoV-2 S protein expressed in mammalian cell lines. In particular, mAb 1A9 was demonstrated to detect S protein in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and is suitable for use in a sandwich ELISA format.ConclusionThe cross-reactive mAbs may serve as useful tools for SARS-CoV-2 research and for the development of diagnostic assays for COVID-19.", "doi": "10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.28.2000291", "pmid": "32700671", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Biochemistry": null, "Category: Imaging": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7376845"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-07T16:22:09.955Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:45:36.612Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "72356b6b1430403297ae0fd5a1af6e57", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/72356b6b1430403297ae0fd5a1af6e57.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/72356b6b1430403297ae0fd5a1af6e57"}}, "title": "Ethical triage during the COVID-19 pandemic: a toolkit for neurosurgical resource allocation.", "authors": [{"family": "Hulsbergen", "given": "Alexander F C", "initials": "AFC"}, {"family": "Eijkholt", "given": "Marleen M", "initials": "MM"}, {"family": "Balak", "given": "Naci", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Brennum", "given": "Jannick", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Bolger", "given": "Ciar\u00e1n", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Bohrer", "given": "Anna-Margarete", "initials": "AM"}, {"family": "Feldman", "given": "Zeev", "initials": "Z"}, {"family": "Holsgrove", "given": "Daniel", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Kitchen", "given": "Neil", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Mathiesen", "given": "Tiit I", "initials": "TI"}, {"family": "Moojen", "given": "Wouter A", "initials": "WA"}, {"family": "Sampr\u00f3n", "given": "Nicol\u00e1s", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Sames", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Sandvik", "given": "Ulrika", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Tisell", "given": "Magnus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Broekman", "given": "Marike L D", "initials": "MLD"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-07-00", "journal": {"title": "Acta Neurochir (Wien)", "issn": "0942-0940", "volume": "162", "issue": "7", "pages": "1485-1490", "issn-l": "0001-6268"}, "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic confronts healthcare workers, including neurosurgeons, with difficult choices regarding which patients to treat.\n\nIn order to assist ethical triage, this article gives an overview of the main considerations and ethical principles relevant when allocating resources in times of scarcity.\n\nWe discuss a framework employing four principles: prioritizing the worst off, maximizing benefits, treating patients equally, and promoting instrumental value.

The scale of the challenge for health systems and public policy means that there is an ineluctable need to prioritize the needs of the many. It is impossible to treat all citizens equally, and a failure to carefully consider the consequences of actions could lead to massive preventable loss of life. In a pandemic there is a strong ethical need to consider how to do most good overall. Utilitarianism is an influential moral theory that states that the right action is the action that is expected to produce the greatest good. It offers clear operationalizable principles. In this paper we provide a summary of how utilitarianism could inform two challenging questions that have been important in the early phase of the pandemic: (a) Triage: which patients should receive access to a ventilator if there is overwhelming demand outstripping supply? (b) Lockdown: how should countries decide when to implement stringent social restrictions, balancing preventing deaths from COVID-19 with causing deaths and reductions in well-being from other causes? Our aim is not to argue that utilitarianism is the only relevant ethical theory, or in favour of a purely utilitarian approach. However, clearly considering which options will do the most good overall will help societies identify and consider the necessary cost of other values.

Although certain NCDs appear to increase the severity of COVID-19 and mortality risk, SARS-CoV-2 infection in survivors with NCDs may also affect the progression of their pre-existing clinical conditions. Infection containment measures will have substantial short- and long-term consequences; social distancing and quarantine restrictions will reduce physical activity and increase other unhealthy lifestyles, thus increasing NCD risk factors and worsening clinical symptoms. Vitamin D levels might decrease and there might be a rise in mental health disorders. Many countries have made changes to routine management of NCD patients, e.g., cancelling non-urgent outpatient visits, which will have important implications for NCD management, diagnosis of new-onset NCDs, medication adherence, and NCD progression. We may have opportunities to learn from this unprecedented crisis on how to leverage healthcare technologies and improve procedures to optimize healthcare service provision. This article discusses how the COVID-19 outbreak and related infection control measures could hit the most frail individuals, worsening the condition of NCD patients, while further jeopardizing the sustainability of the healthcare systems.

Data on clinical manifestations, maternal and perinatal outcomes including vertical transmission were extracted and analyzed.\n\nEighteen articles reporting data from 108 pregnancies between 8 December 2019 and 1 April 2020 were included in the current study. Most reports described women presenting in the third trimester with fever (68%) and coughing (34%).

Three maternal intensive care unit admissions were noted but no maternal deaths. One neonatal death and one intrauterine death were also reported.\n\nAlthough the majority of mothers were discharged without any major complications, severe maternal morbidity as a result of COVID-19 and perinatal deaths were reported.

We established the COronavirus Pandemic Epidemiology (COPE) consortium to address this unprecedented crisis on behalf of the epidemiology research community. As a central component of this initiative, we have developed a COVID Symptom Study (previously known as the COVID Symptom Tracker) mobile application as a common data collection tool for epidemiologic cohort studies with active study participants. This mobile application collects information on risk factors, daily symptoms, and outcomes through a user-friendly interface that minimizes participant burden. Combined with our efforts within the general population, data collected from nearly 3 million participants in the United States and United Kingdom are being used to address critical needs in the emergency response, including identifying potential hot spots of disease and clinically actionable risk factors. The linkage of symptom data collected in the app with information and biospecimens already collected in epidemiology cohorts will position us to address key questions related to diet, lifestyle, environmental, and socioeconomic factors on susceptibility to COVID-19, clinical outcomes related to infection, and long-term physical, mental health, and financial sequalae.

Considering the easy virus spread through respiratory droplets produced with cough, sneezes or spit or through close contact with infected people or surfaces, healthcare workers are further exposed to COVID-19. Particularly, echocardiography remains an essential diagnostic service which, due to the close contact with patients during the exam, provides echocardiographers high-risk of contagion. Therefore, the common modalities of performing echocardiography should be improved in this scenario, avoiding performing unnecessary exams, using the appropriate personal protective equipment depending on patients' status and location, optimizing time-effectiveness of the echocardiographic study and accurately sanitizing the environment and devices after each exam. This paper aims to provide a simple guide for the clinicians to balance between providing the best care to each patient and protecting themselves and other patients from the spread of the virus.

The cholinergic antiinflammatory mechanism ameliorates pulmonary inflammation by inhibiting HMGB1 release and HMGB1 receptor expression. This comprehension was recently reinforced by results reported in Molecular Medicine by Sitapara and coworkers demonstrating that administration of an \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist attenuated hyperoxia-induced acute inflammatory lung injury by alleviating the accumulation of HMGB1 in the airways and the circulation.

SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster than its two ancestors, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV), but has low fatality rates. Our analyses speculate that the efficient replication and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 might be due to the high-density basic amino acid residues, preferably positioned in close proximity at both the furin-like cleavage sites (S1/S2 and S2') within the spike protein. Given the high genomic similarities of SARS-CoV-2 to bat SARS-like CoVs, it is likely that bats serve as a reservoir host for its progenitor. Women and children are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, while the elderly and people with comorbidities are more prone to serious clinical outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. The cohesive approach amongst researchers across the globe has delivered high-end viral diagnostics. However, home-based point-of-care diagnostics are still under development, which may prove transformative in current COVID-19 pandemic containment. Similarly, vaccines and therapeutics against COVID-19 are currently in the pipeline for clinical trials. In this review, we discuss the noteworthy advancements, focusing on the etiological viral agent, comparative genomic analysis, population susceptibility, disease epidemiology and diagnosis, animal reservoirs, laboratory animal models, disease transmission, therapeutics, vaccine challenges, and disease mitigation measures.", "doi": "10.3390/pathogens9070519", "pmid": "32605194", "labels":

Focusing on Italy, one of the hardest hit countries, we look at how these two values could be put in perspective to reflect the dynamics of the virus spread. In particular, we find that merely considering the confirmed case counts would be very misleading. The number of daily tests grows, while the daily fraction of confirmed cases to total tests has a change point. It (depending on region) generally increases with strong fluctuations till (around, depending on region) 15-22 March and then decreases linearly after. Combined with the increasing trend of daily performed tests, the raw confirmed case counts are not representative of the situation and are confounded with the sampling effort. This we observe when regressing on time the logged fraction of positive tests and for comparison the logged raw confirmed count. Hence, calibrating model parameters for this virus's dynamics should not be done based only on confirmed case counts (without rescaling by the number of tests), but take also fatalities and hospitalization count under consideration as variables not prone to be distorted by testing efforts. Furthermore, reporting statistics on the national level does not say much about the dynamics of the disease, which are taking place at the regional level. These findings are based on the official data of total death counts up to 15 April 2020 released by ISTAT and up to 10 May 2020 for the number of cases. In this work, we do not fit models but we rather investigate whether this task is possible at all.

This study aimed to describe data from admission to follow-up for patients with COVID-19 and analyze the possible causes for re-positive nucleic acid tests to provide more scientific basis for reducing the numbers of re-positive patients after discharge. Methods: We retrospectively recorded 15 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Xianyang Central Hospital, China. The baseline, exposure histories, clinical syndromes, laboratory characteristics, nucleic acid, and follow-up tests were analyzed, and the radiological characteristics of re-positive patient at different periods were compared. Results: Eight (53.33%) patients had the history of travel to Wuhan, four (26.67%) patients had close contact with confirmed patients, and one (6.67%) patient had close contact with suspected patients. After treatment, all patients had two consecutively negative nucleic acid tests and were discharged from hospital. All patients were followed up for more than 14 days, and the average time from discharge to the first follow-up was 14.67 \u00b1 3.31 days (from 9 to 22 days). Most patients showed no clinical symptoms and negative nucleic acid tests, while one patient had an itchy throat, her CT scan showed a light density shadow in the right lower lobe of the lung, and the nucleic acid was once again positive. The second follow-up of the other 14 patients (except the re-positive one) was conducted 20.80 \u00b1 7.78 days (from 13 to 30 days) after discharge, and all of them had negative nucleic acid tests. The positive patient was immediately readmitted and received a new round of treatment. Her family members and colleagues remained healthy until now. Conclusions: The quality of nucleic acid testing reagents should be enhanced, and the training of nucleic acid sampling operators should be strengthened to reduce the false-negative results in the nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2; the clinical specimens of throat and nasopharynx swabs can be collected at the same time; IgM- and IgG-specific antibodies of SARS-CoV-2 should be carried out for discharged patients; the radiological characteristics should be evaluated strictly; and the discharge standard can be specified according to the baseline and severity of disease of patients.", "doi": "10.3389/fmed.2020.00349", "pmid": "32656223", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "NA", "key": "All data provided in the article", "description": null}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-08T14:14:57.177Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:45:48.527Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "9428858ffe57443e8565e9bc0c31a4de", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/9428858ffe57443e8565e9bc0c31a4de.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/9428858ffe57443e8565e9bc0c31a4de"}}, "title": "Maximizing Safety in the Conduct of Alzheimer's Disease Fluid Biomarker Research in the Era of COVID-19.", "authors": [{"family": "Schindler", "given": "Suzanne E", "initials": "SE"}, {"family": "Jicha", "given": "Gregory A", "initials": "GA"}, {"family": "Nelson", "given": "Peter T", "initials": "PT"}, {"family": "Keene", "given": "C Dirk", "initials": "CD"}, {"family": "Blennow", "given": "Kaj", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Molinuevo", "given": "Jos\u00e9 Luis", "initials": "JL"}, {"family": "Masters", "given": "Colin L", "initials": "CL"}, {"family": "Hansson", "given": "Oskar", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Teunissen", "given": "Charlotte E", "initials": "CE"}, {"family": "Galasko", "given": "Douglas", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Shaw", "given": "Leslie M", "initials": "LM"}, {"family": "Levey", "given": "Allan I", "initials": "AI"}, {"family": "Silverberg", "given": "Nina", "initials": "N"}], "type": "letter", "published": "2020-06-23", "journal": {"title": "J Alzheimers Dis", "issn": "1875-8908", "volume": "76", "issue": "1", "pages": "27-31", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to an abrupt halt of many Alzheimer's disease (AD) research studies at sites spanning the world.

We have investigated the possibility of using the Stryker Flyte surgical helmet as a respiratory protective device against airborne- and droplet-transmitted disease, since the helmet shares many features with powered air-purifying respirators.Materials and methods - Using an aerosol particle generator, we determined the filtration capacity of the Stryker Flyte helmet by placing particle counters measuring the concentrations of 0.3, 0.5, and 5 \u00b5m particles inside and outside of the helmet.Results - We found that the helmet has insufficient capacity for filtrating aerosol particles, and, for 0.3 \u00b5m sized particles, we even recorded an accumulation of particles inside the helmet.Interpretation - We conclude that the Stryker Flyte surgical helmet should not be used as a respiratory protective device when there is a risk for exposure to aerosol containing SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, in accordance with the recommendation from the manufacturer.", "doi": "10.1080/17453674.2020.1771525", "pmid": "32573285", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-08T16:25:11.699Z", "modified": "2020-12-08T16:25:11.711Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "2370821b31b14cf8a22f331c2d6bbe77", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/2370821b31b14cf8a22f331c2d6bbe77.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/2370821b31b14cf8a22f331c2d6bbe77"}}, "title": "COVID-19 IDD: A global survey exploring the impact of COVID-19 on individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their caregivers.", "authors": [{"family": "Linehan", "given": "Christine", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Araten-Bergam", "given": "Tal", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Beadle-Brown", "given": "Julie", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Bigby", "given": "Christine", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Birkbeck", "given": "Gail", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Bradley", "given": "Valerie", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Brown", "given": "Michael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Bredewold", "given": "Femmianne", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Chirwa", "given": "Masauso", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Kanova", "given": "Sarka", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Kroll", "given": "Thilo", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "MacLachlan", "given": "Mac", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Narayan", "given": "Jayanthi", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Nearchou", "given": "Finiki", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Nolan", "given": "Adam", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "O'Donovan", "given": "Mary-Ann", "initials": "MA"}, {"family": "Santos", "given": "Flavia H", "initials": "FH"}, {"family": "Siska", "given": "Jan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Tideman", "given": "Magnus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Tossebro", "given": "Jan", "initials": "J"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-06-23", "journal": {"title": "HRB Open Res", "issn": "2515-4826", "volume": "3", "issue": null, "pages": "39", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Background: This protocol outlines research to explore the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on individuals who have intellectual and developmental disabilities and their caregivers.

Methods: An anonymous online survey will be conducted with caregivers, both family members and paid staff, to explore the impact of COVID-19 on this population in terms of demographics, living arrangements, access to services, the impact of social distancing, and also carer wellbeing. The survey will be developed by the research team, many of whom are experts in intellectual disability within their own jurisdictions. Using back-translation our team will translate the survey for distribution in 16 countries worldwide for international comparison. The survey team have extensive personal and professional networks in intellectual disability and will promote the survey widely on social media with the support of local disability and advocacy agencies.

Hereby, based on literature review from the current pandemic and previous outbreaks with corona viruses we analyze the impact of the virus infection on cell stress responses and redox balance. High levels of mortality are noticed in elderly individuals infected with SARS-CoV2 and during the previous SARS-CoV1 outbreak. Elderly individuals maintain a chronic low level of inflammation which is associated with oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine production, a condition that increases the severity of viral infections in this population. Coronavirus infections can lead to alterations of redox balance in infected cells through modulation of NAD + biosynthesis, PARP function along with altering proteasome and mitochondrial function in the cell thereby leading to enhanced cell stress responses which further exacerbate inflammation. ROS production can increase IL-6 production and lipid peroxidation resulting in cell damage. Therefore, early treatment with anti-oxidants such as NAC during COVID-19 can be a way to bypass the excessive inflammation and cell damage that lead to severe infection, thus early NAC as intervention should be evaluated in a clinical trial setti", "doi": "10.1016/j.toxrep.2020.06.003", "pmid": "32632359", "labels": {"Funder: KAW/SciLifeLab": null, "Type: Review": null, "Research Area: Drug discovery and repurposing of drugs": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-04T07:09:44.267Z", "modified": "2021-01-31T11:59:52.961Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "0ddad22d61894a518568a0db3ecbf194", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/0ddad22d61894a518568a0db3ecbf194.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/0ddad22d61894a518568a0db3ecbf194"}}, "title": "Creating misinformation: how a headline in The BMJ about covid-19 spread virally.", "authors": [{"family": "Winters", "given": "Maike", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Oppenheim", "given": "Ben", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Pick", "given": "Jonas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Nordenstedt", "given": "Helena", "initials": "H"}], "type": "letter", "published": "2020-06-18", "journal": {"title": "BMJ", "issn": "1756-1833", "volume": "369", "issue": null, "pages": "m2384", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1136/bmj.m2384", "pmid": "32554782", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-09T07:46:47.709Z", "modified": "2020-12-09T07:46:47.718Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "4c3bed3cd46f43f491164d00cd961e01", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/4c3bed3cd46f43f491164d00cd961e01.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/4c3bed3cd46f43f491164d00cd961e01"}}, "title": "The Coronavirus Pandemic and Lessons Learned in Preschools in Norway, Sweden and the United States: OMEP Policy Forum.", "authors": [{"family": "Pramling Samuelsson", "given": "Ingrid", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Wagner", "given": "Judith T", "initials": "JT"}, {"family": "Eriksen \u00d8degaard", "given": "Elin", "initials": "E"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-06-17", "journal": {"title": "Int J Early Child", "issn": "0020-7187", "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": "1-16", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "The novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, has moved rapidly across the world in 2020.

The constant news coverage, rapid transmission, and relatively high mortality rate, make fearfulness a natural response. To assess the fear of COVID-19, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) was developed. The primary aim of the present study was to conduct the first psychometric assessment and validation of the English version of the FCV-19S. Two samples were collected in New Zealand. Sample 1 comprised 1624 participants of which 1397 completed all questions and were used in the analyses. Sample 2 comprised 1111 participants of which 1023 completed all questions and were used in the analyses. Several psychometric tests were conducted to ascertain the scale's reliability and validity. Across both samples, the FCV-19S had high internal consistency. Consistent with the earlier validation studies, the FCV-19S displayed a moderately strong relationship with the perceived infectability and germ aversion subscales of the perceived vulnerability to disease scale (PVDS). Furthermore, FCV-19S scores were negatively correlated with the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS) scores. With respect to the motivating role of fear, there was a significant relationship between FCV-19S scores and adherence to the lockdown rules that were implemented in New Zealand. Finally, consistent with recent reports on the politicization of the COVID-19 pandemic, an exploratory question found that participants who rated themselves as more conservative tended to report lower FCV-19S scores. The English version of the COVID-19S is a sound unidimensional scale with robust psychometric properties and can be used with confidence among English-speaking populations.", "doi": "10.1007/s11469-020-00342-9", "pmid": "32837431", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "342"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7295324"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-07T10:35:30.325Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:45:48.294Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "2d6e328ee4c3402cb4cf9ce713a48b68", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/2d6e328ee4c3402cb4cf9ce713a48b68.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/2d6e328ee4c3402cb4cf9ce713a48b68"}}, "title": "Analysing the Combined Health, Social and Economic Impacts of the Corovanvirus Pandemic Using Agent-Based Social Simulation.", "authors": [{"family": "Dignum", "given": "Frank", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Dignum", "given": "Virginia", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Davidsson", "given": "Paul", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Ghorbani", "given": "Amineh", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "van der Hurk", "given": "Mijke", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Jensen", "given": "Maarten", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Kammler", "given": "Christian", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Lorig", "given": "Fabian", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Ludescher", "given": "Luis Gustavo", "initials": "LG"}, {"family": "Melchior", "given": "Alexander", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Mellema", "given": "Ren\u00e9", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Pastrav", "given": "Cezara", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Vanhee", "given": "Lo\u00efs", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Verhagen", "given": "Harko", "initials": "H"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-06-15", "journal": {"title": "Minds Mach (Dordr)", "issn": "0924-6495", "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": "1-18", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "During the COVID-19 crisis there have been many difficult decisions governments and other decision makers had to make.

These recommendations are grouped into nine sections on different relevant aspects for the care of patients with allergies.\n\nThis international Position Paper provides recommendations on operational plans and procedures to maintain high standards in the daily clinical care of allergic patients whilst ensuring necessary safety in the current COVID-19 pandemic.", "doi": "10.1111/all.14453", "pmid": "32531110", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7323448"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-25T09:59:36.828Z", "modified": "2021-04-23T16:11:47.867Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "a11cb5cd27c844e589b01a7d4df0c679", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/a11cb5cd27c844e589b01a7d4df0c679.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/a11cb5cd27c844e589b01a7d4df0c679"}}, "title": "Associations Between Fear of COVID-19, Mental Health, and Preventive Behaviours Across Pregnant Women and Husbands: An Actor-Partner Interdependence Modelling.", "authors": [{"family": "Ahorsu", "given": "Daniel Kwasi", "initials": "DK"}, {"family": "Imani", "given": "Vida", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Lin", "given": "Chung-Ying", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Timpka", "given": "Toomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Brostr\u00f6m", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Updegraff", "given": "John A", "initials": "JA"}, {"family": "\u00c5restedt", "given": "Kristofer", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Griffiths", "given": "Mark D", "initials": "MD"}, {"family": "Pakpour", "given": "Amir H", "initials": "AH"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-06-11", "journal": {"title": "Int J Ment Health Addict", "issn": "1557-1874", "issn-l": null, "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": "1-15"}, "abstract": "The present cross-sectional study examined the actor-partner interdependence effect of fear of COVID-19 among Iranian pregnant women and their husbands and its association with their mental health and preventive behaviours during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

The findings demonstrated significant dyadic relationships between husbands and their pregnant wives' fear of COVID-19, mental health, and preventive behaviours. Pregnant wives' actor effect of fear of COVID-19 was significantly associated with depression, suicidal intention, mental quality of life, and COVID-19 preventive behaviours but not anxiety. Moreover, a husband actor effect of fear of COVID-19 was significantly associated with depression, anxiety, suicidal intention, mental quality of life, and COVID-19 preventive behaviours. Additionally, there were significant partner effects observed for both the pregnant wives and their husbands concerning all outcomes. The present study used a cross-sectional design and so is unable to determine the mechanism or causal ordering of the effects.

Methods: We identified COVID-19 patients who admitted to Xiangyang No. 1 People's Hospital and presented with gastrointestinal symptoms as their initial or main symptoms. Their medical records were reviewed by two independent clinical scientists. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics as well as the clinical outcomes were analyzed. Results: Among 142 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 7 (4.9%) of them presented with gastrointestinal symptoms. Three patients had gastrointestinal symptoms as the initial symptoms and chief complaints, and 4 patients as the main symptoms during disease progression. Six patients had symptoms of diarrhea (3-16 days), 7 with anorexia (7-22 days), 6 with upper abdominal discomfort (1-7 days), and 4 with nausea (1-7 days), 1 with heartburn lasting 2 days, and 2 with vomiting symptoms (1 day). The chest CT scan showed typical COVID-19 imaging features, and associated with the progression of the disease. During treatment, 2 patients died due to organ failure. Discussion: COVID-19 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms are relatively rare and might be misdiagnosed. The clinical features include watery stools, anorexia, and upper abdominal discomfort. These patients may have severe disease and be associated with a poor prognosis.

The performance of the developed method for HCQ measurement in serum was further evaluated by comparison with two previously reported extraction methods.\r\n\r\nThe performance of the presented method demonstrated high accuracy and precision. A large range of HCQ concentrations was observed for the SLE patients in all three matrices (WB, serum, and plasma). The mean levels in WB were approximately two-fold the levels in serum and plasma (813 ng/mL compared to 436 ng/mL and 362 ng/mL, respectively). Spiked quality controls showed high reproducibility for all matrices (coefficient of variation, CV, approx. 5%), whereas in patient samples, equally high-precision was only found using WB as the matrix (CV 3%). The CV for serum and plasma was 14% and 39%, respectively. Two alternative methods applied to serum samples did not demonstrate improved precision.\r\n\r\nA LC-HRMS method for the measurement of HCQ in human blood was developed and validated. Whole blood was found to be the superior sample matrix in terms of sample reproducibility. Thus, whole blood samples should be used for HCQ analysis when patients are monitored for HCQ treatment effects. The assay is in clinical use to monitor levels of HCQ in patients.", "doi": "10.1186/s13075-020-02211-1", "pmid": "32475347", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Health": null, "Category: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1186/s13075-020-02211-1"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7261520"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-19T14:50:28.058Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:46:13.524Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "c1e74612a5d64ee89229777ca2d62d81", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/c1e74612a5d64ee89229777ca2d62d81.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/c1e74612a5d64ee89229777ca2d62d81"}}, "title": "Recommendations for the management of patients with immune-mediated kidney disease during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic.", "authors": [{"family": "Anders", "given": "Hans-Joachim", "initials": "HJ"}, {"family": "Bruchfeld", "given": "Annette", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Fernandez Juarez", "given": "Gema Maria", "initials": "GM"}, {"family": "Floege", "given": "J\u00fcrgen", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Goumenos", "given": "Dimitrios", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Turkmen", "given": "Kultigin", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "van Kooten", "given": "Cees", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Tesar", "given": "Vladimir", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Segelmark", "given": "M\u00e5rten", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-06-01", "journal": {"title": "Nephrol Dial Transplant", "issn": "1460-2385", "volume": "35", "issue": "6", "pages": "920-925", "issn-l": "0931-0509"}, "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created major challenges for all countries around the globe.

It was declared by the WHO as a public health emergency. The most susceptible populations, needing mechanical ventilation, are the elderly and people with associated comorbidities. There is an important risk of contagion for anesthetists, dentists, head and neck surgeons, maxillofacial surgeons, ophthalmologists, and otolaryngologists. Health workers represent between 3.8% and 20% of the infected population; some 15% will develop severe complaints and among them, many will lose their lives. A large number of patients do not have overt signs and symptoms (fever/respiratory), yet pose a real risk to surgeons (who should know this fact and must therefore apply respiratory protective strategies for all patients they encounter). All interventions that have the potential to aerosolize aerodigestive secretions should be avoided or used only when mandatory. Health workers who are: pregnant, over 55 to 65 years of age, with a history of chronic diseases (uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and all clinical scenarios where immunosuppression is feasible, including that induced to treat chronic inflammatory conditions and organ transplants) should avoid the clinical attention of a potentially infected patient. Health care facilities should prioritize urgent and emergency visits and procedures until the present condition stabilizes; truly elective care should cease and discussed on a case-by-case basis for patients with cancer. For those who are working with COVID-19 infected patients' isolation is compulsory in the following settings: (a) unprotected close contact with COVID-19 pneumonia patients; (b) onset of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and other symptoms (gastrointestinal complaints, anosmia, and dysgeusia have been reported in a minority of cases). For any care or intervention in the upper aerodigestive tract region, irrespective of the setting and a confirmed diagnosis (eg, rhinoscopy or flexible laryngoscopy in the outpatient setting and tracheostomy or rigid endoscopy under anesthesia), it is strongly recommended that all health care personnel wear personal protective equipment such as N95, gown, cap, eye protection, and gloves. The procedures described are essential in trying to maintain safety of health care workers during COVID-19 pandemic.

A central question concerning COVID-19 is why some individuals become sick and others not. Many have pointed already at variation in risk factors between individuals. However, the variable outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections may, at least in part, be due also to differences between the viral subspecies with which individuals are infected. A more pertinent question is how we are to overcome the current pandemic. A vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 would offer significant relief, although vaccine developers have warned that design, testing and production of vaccines may take a year if not longer. Vaccines are based on a handful of different designs (i), but the earliest vaccines were based on the live, attenuated virus. As has been the case for other viruses during earlier pandemics, SARS-CoV-2 will mutate and may naturally attenuate over time (ii). What makes the current pandemic unique is that, thanks to state-of-the-art nucleic acid sequencing technologies, we can follow in detail how SARS-CoV-2 evolves while it spreads.

to best provide ophthalmic care for patients with retinal disease receiving intravitreal injections with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents during the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic. This article provides guidance for ophthalmologists on how to deliver the best possible care for patients while minimizing the risk of infection.\n\nThe Vision Academy's Steering Committee of international retinal disease experts convened to discuss key considerations for managing patients with retinal disease during the COVID-19 pandemic. After reviewing the existing literature on the issue, members put forward recommendations that were systematically refined and voted on to develop this guidance.\n\nThe considerations focus on the implementation of steps to minimize the exposure of patients and healthcare staff to COVID-19. These include the use of personal protective equipment, adherence to scrupulous hygiene and disinfection protocols, pre-screening to identify symptomatic patients, and reducing the number of people in waiting rooms. Other important measures include triaging of patients to identify those at the greatest risk of irreversible vision loss and prioritization of treatment visits over monitoring visits where possible. In order to limit patient exposure, ophthalmologists should refrain from using treatment regimens that require frequent monitoring.\n\nManagement of patients with retinal disease receiving intravitreal injections during the COVID-19 pandemic will require adjustment to regular clinical practice to minimize the risk of exposure of patients and healthcare staff, and to prioritize those with the greatest medical need. The safety of patients and healthcare staff should be of paramount importance in all decision-making.", "doi": "10.1007/s00417-020-04703-x", "pmid": "32328757", "labels": {"Type: Review": null},

hardship for individuals and hampers disease control efforts as people struggle to stay home when sick or advised to observe quarantine. Evidence on income security during periods of ill health is growing but has not previously been reviewed as a full body of work concerning low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). We performed a scoping review to map the range, features, coverage, protective effects and equity of policies that aim to provide income security for adults whose ill health prevents them from participating in gainful work. A total of 134 studies were included, providing data from 95% of LMICs. However, data across the majority of these countries were severely limited. Collectively the included studies demonstrate that coverage of contributory income-security schemes is low, especially for informal and low-income workers. Meanwhile, non-contributory schemes targeting low-income groups are often not explicitly designed to provide income support in periods of ill health, they can be difficult to access and rarely provide sufficient income support to cover the needs of eligible recipients. While identifying an urgent need for more research on illness-related income security in LMICs, this review concludes that scaling up and diversifying the range of income security interventions is crucial for improving coverage and equity. To achieve these outcomes, illness-related income protection must receive greater recognition in health policy and health financing circles, expanding our understanding of financial hardship beyond direct medical costs.", "doi": "10.1136/bmjgh-2020-002425", "pmid": "32540963", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "bmjgh-2020-002425"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7299014"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-25T10:01:53.442Z", "modified": "2020-11-30T08:59:22.813Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "88f3f44ed037429b84b2679f50149fb2", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/88f3f44ed037429b84b2679f50149fb2.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/88f3f44ed037429b84b2679f50149fb2"}}, "title": "Surveillance to improve evidence for community control decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic - Opening the animal epidemic toolbox for Public Health.", "authors": [{"family": "Foddai", "given": "Alessandro", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Lindberg", "given": "Ann", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Lubroth", "given": "Juan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Ellis-Iversen", "given": "Johanne", "initials": "J"}], "type": "editorial", "published": "2020-06-00", "journal": {"title": "One Health", "issn": "2352-7714", "volume": "9", "issue": null, "pages": "100130", "issn-l": "2352-7714"}, "abstract": "During the first few months of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic reached Europe and spread around the world.

First, we document the efficacy of quarantine in ceasing movement. Second, we show that the distribution of population outflow from Wuhan accurately predicts the relative frequency and geographical distribution of infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) until 19 February 2020, across mainland China. Third, we develop a spatio-temporal 'risk source' model that leverages population flow data (which operationalize the risk that emanates from epidemic epicentres) not only to forecast the distribution of confirmed cases, but also to identify regions that have a high risk of transmission at an early stage. Fourth, we use this risk source model to statistically derive the geographical spread of COVID-19 and the growth pattern based on the population outflow from Wuhan; the model yields a benchmark trend and an index for assessing the risk of community transmission of COVID-19 over time for different locations. This approach can be used by policy-makers in any nation with available data to make rapid and accurate risk assessments and to plan the allocation of limited resources ahead of ongoing outbreaks.", "doi": "10.1038/s41586-020-2284-y", "pmid": "32349120", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Health": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "URL", "key": "https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-020-2284-y/MediaObjects/41586_2020_2284_MOESM3_ESM.xlsx", "description": "Population outflow data from Wuhan from January 1-24, 2020; COVID-19 case counts as of February 19 and other data for 296 prefectures in mainland China"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-25T07:14:25.611Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:45:48.422Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "7d9967664a4443e28cf52c8f6bf32d7a", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7d9967664a4443e28cf52c8f6bf32d7a.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7d9967664a4443e28cf52c8f6bf32d7a"}}, "title": "Flash survey on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infections in paediatric patients on anticancer treatment.", "authors": [{"family": "Hrusak", "given": "Ondrej", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Kalina", "given": "Tomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Wolf", "given": "Joshua", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Balduzzi", "given": "Adriana", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Provenzi", "given": "Massimo", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Rizzari", "given": "Carmelo", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Rives", "given": "Susana", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Del Pozo Carlavilla", "given": "Mar\u00eda", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Alonso", "given": "Maria E V", "initials": "MEV"}, {"family": "Dom\u00ednguez-Pinilla", "given": "Nerea", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Bourquin", "given": "Jean-Pierre", "initials": "JP"}, {"family": "Schmiegelow", "given": "Kjeld", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Attarbaschi", "given": "Andishe", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Grillner", "given": "Pernilla", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Mellgren", "given": "Karin", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "van der Werff Ten Bosch", "given": "Jutte", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Pieters", "given": "Rob", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Brozou", "given": "Triantafyllia", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Borkhardt", "given": "Arndt", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Escherich", "given": "Gabriele", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Lauten", "given": "Melchior", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Stanulla", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Smith", "given": "Owen", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Yeoh", "given": "Allen E J", "initials": "AEJ"}, {"family": "Elitzur", "given": "Sarah", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Vora", "given": "Ajay", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Li", "given": "Chi-Kong", "initials": "CK"}, {"family": "Ariffin", "given": "Hany", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Kolenova", "given": "Alexandra", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Dallapozza", "given": "Luciano", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Farah", "given": "Roula", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Lazic", "given": "Jelena", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Manabe", "given": "Atsushi", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Styczynski", "given": "Jan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Kovacs", "given": "Gabor", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Ottoffy", "given": "Gabor", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Felice", "given": "Maria S", "initials": "MS"}, {"family": "Buldini", "given": "Barbara", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Conter", "given": "Valentino", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Stary", "given": "Jan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Schrappe", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-06-00", "journal": {"title": "Eur J Cancer", "issn": "1879-0852", "volume": "132", "issue": null, "pages": "11-16", "issn-l": "0959-8049"}, "abstract": "Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, it is known that the severe course of the disease occurs mostly among the elderly, whereas it is rare among children and young adults. Comorbidities, in particular, diabetes and hypertension, clearly associated with age, besides obesity and smoke, are strongly associated with the need for intensive treatment and a dismal outcome. A weaker immunity of the elderly has been proposed as a possible explanation of this uneven age distribution. Thus, there is concern that children treated for cancer may allso be at risk for an unfavourable course of infection. Along the same line, anecdotal information from Wuhan, China, mentioned a severe course of COVID-19 in a child treated for leukaemia.\n\nWe made a flash survey on COVID-19 incidence and severity among children on anticancer treatment. Respondents were asked by email to fill in a short Web-based survey.\n\nWe received reports from 25 countries, where approximately 10,000 patients at risk are followed up. At the time of the survey, more than 200 of these children were tested, nine of whom were positive for COVID-19. Eight of the nine cases had asymptomatic to mild disease, and one was just diagnosed with COVID-19. We also discuss preventive measures that are in place or should be taken and treatment options in immunocompromised children with COVID-19.\n\nThus, even children receiving anticancer chemotherapy may have a mild or asymptomatic course of COVID-19. While we should not underestimate the risk of developing a more severe course of COVID-19 than that observed here, the intensity of preventive measures should not cause delays or obstructions in oncological treatment.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ejca.2020.03.021", "pmid": "32305831", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0959-8049(20)30162-3"}, {"db": "pmc", "key":

We explore the psychological, social, and neuroscientific effects of COVID-19 and set out the immediate priorities and longer-term strategies for mental health science research. These priorities were informed by surveys of the public and an expert panel convened by the UK Academy of Medical Sciences and the mental health research charity, MQ: Transforming Mental Health, in the first weeks of the pandemic in the UK in March, 2020. We urge UK research funding agencies to work with researchers, people with lived experience, and others to establish a high level coordination group to ensure that these research priorities are addressed, and to allow new ones to be identified over time. The need to maintain high-quality research standards is imperative. International collaboration and a global perspective will be beneficial. An immediate priority is collecting high-quality data on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across the whole population and vulnerable groups, and on brain function, cognition, and mental health of patients with COVID-19. There is an urgent need for research to address how mental health consequences for vulnerable groups can be mitigated under pandemic conditions, and on the impact of repeated media consumption and health messaging around COVID-19. Discovery, evaluation, and refinement of mechanistically driven interventions to address the psychological, social, and neuroscientific aspects of the pandemic are required. Rising to this challenge will require integration across disciplines and sectors, and should be done together with people with lived experience. New funding will be required to meet these priorities, and it can be efficiently leveraged by the UK's world-leading infrastructure.

All available whole genome sequence data from the NCBI database (March 16, 2020) were phylogenetically analyzed, and gene prediction as well as analysis of selected variants were performed. Antigenic regions and the secondary protein structure were predicted for selected variants. While some clusters are presenting the same variant with 100% identical bases, other SARS-CoV-2 lineages show a beginning diversification and phylogenetic clustering due to base substitutions and deletions in the genomes.

For countries that have implemented restrictions on its population in a step-wise manner, monitoring of COVID-19 prevalence is of importance to guide decision on when to impose new, or when to abolish old, restrictions. We are here determining whether measures of odor intensity in a large sample can serve as one such measure. Online measures of how intense common household odors are perceived and symptoms of COVID-19 were collected from 2440 Swedes. Average odor intensity ratings were then compared to predicted COVID-19 population prevalence over time in the Swedish population and were found to closely track each other (r=-0.83). Moreover, we found that there was a large difference in rated intensity between individuals with and without COVID-19 symptoms and number of symptoms was related to odor intensity ratings. Finally, we found that individuals progressing from reporting no symptoms to subsequently reporting COVID-19 symptoms demonstrated a large drop in olfactory performance. These data suggest that measures of odor intensity, if obtained in a large and representative sample, can be used as an indicator of COVID-19 disease in the general population. Importantly, this simple measure could easily be implemented in countries without widespread access to COVID-19 testing or implemented as a fast early response before wide-spread testing can be facilitated.", "doi": "10.1093/chemse/bjaa034", "pmid": "32441744", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "5842049"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7314115"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-25T09:11:13.432Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:46:13.212Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "3f3785befa6c48f79fd5365680857182", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/3f3785befa6c48f79fd5365680857182.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/3f3785befa6c48f79fd5365680857182"}}, "title": "Gambling During the COVID-19 Crisis - A Cause for Concern.", "authors": [{"family": "H\u00e5kansson", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Aranda", "given": "Fernando", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Mench\u00f3n", "given": "Jose M", "initials": "JM"}, {"family": "Potenza", "given": "Marc N", "initials": "MN"}, {"family": "Jim\u00e9nez-Murcia", "given": "Susana", "initials": "S"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-05-21", "journal": {"title": "J Addict Med", "issn": "1935-3227", "volume": "14", "issue": "4", "pages": "e10-e12", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": ": The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to worsen mental health problems in the general population, including increasing engagement in addictive behaviors.

On 3 February, 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 on cruise ship Diamond Princess was reported with 10 initial cases, following an index case on board around 21-25th January. By 4th February, public health measures such as removal and isolation of ill passengers and quarantine of non-ill passengers were implemented. By 20th February, 619 of 3700 passengers and crew (17%) were tested positive.\r\n\r\nWe estimated the basic reproduction number from the initial period of the outbreak using SEIR models. We calibrated the models with transient functions of countermeasures to incidence data. We additionally estimated a counterfactual scenario in absence of countermeasures, and established a model stratified by crew and guests to study the impact of differential contact rates among the groups. We also compared scenarios of an earlier versus later evacuation of the ship.\r\n\r\nThe basic reproduction rate was initially 4 times higher on-board compared to the ${R}_0$ in the epicentre in Wuhan, but the countermeasures lowered it substantially. Based on the modeled initial ${R}_0$ of 14.8, we estimated that without any interventions within the time period of 21 January to 19 February, 2920 out of the 3700 (79%) would have been infected. Isolation and quarantine therefore prevented 2307 cases, and lowered the ${R}_0$ to 1.78. We showed that an early evacuation of all passengers on 3 February would have been associated with 76 infected persons in their incubation time.\r\n\r\nThe cruise ship conditions clearly amplified an already highly transmissible disease.

Considering that the pandemic is a recent event, no large clinical trials have been possible and since coronavirus specific drug are not yet available, there is no strong consensus on how to treat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated viral pneumonia. Coronaviruses code for an important multifunctional enzyme named papain-like protease (PLP), that has many roles in pathogenesis. First, PLP is one of the two viral cysteine proteases, along with 3-chymotripsin-like protease, that is responsible for the production of the replicase proteins required for viral replication. Second, its intrinsic deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities serve to antagonize the host's immune response that would otherwise hinder infection. Both deubiquitinating and deISGylating functions involve the removal of the small regulatory polypeptides, ubiquitin and ISG15, respectively, from target proteins. Ubiquitin modifications can regulate the innate immune response by affecting regulatory proteins, either by altering their stability via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway or by directly regulating their activity. ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like modifier with pleiotropic effects, typically expressed during the host cell immune response. PLP inhibitors have been evaluated during past coronavirus epidemics, and have showed promising results as an antiviral therapy in vitro. In this review, we recapitulate the roles of PLPs in coronavirus infections, report a list of PLP inhibitors and suggest possible therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 treatment, using both clinical and preclinical drugs.", "doi": "10.3390/ijms21103492", "pmid": "32429099", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "ijms21103492"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7278987"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-30T09:04:50.366Z", "modified": "2020-11-30T09:04:50.379Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "a956b3bcb88f402da5231b8f655fa49e", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/a956b3bcb88f402da5231b8f655fa49e.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/a956b3bcb88f402da5231b8f655fa49e"}}, "title": "Why people failed to adhere to COVID-19 preventive behaviors?

ACE2 has now also been identified as a key receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and it has been proposed that inhibiting this interaction might be used in treating patients with COVID-19. However, it is not known whether human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) blocks growth of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that clinical grade hrsACE2 reduced SARS-CoV-2 recovery from Vero cells by a factor of 1,000-5,000. An equivalent mouse rsACE2 had no effect. We also show that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect engineered human blood vessel organoids and human kidney organoids, which can be inhibited by hrsACE2.

The infection can be life threatening and require intensive care treatment. The transmission of the disease poses a risk to both patients and healthcare workers. The number of patients requiring hospital admission and intensive care may overwhelm health systems and negatively affect standard care for patients presenting with conditions needing emergency interventions. This position statements aims to assist cardiologists in the invasive management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. To that end, we assembled a panel of interventional cardiologists and acute cardiac care specialists appointed by the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI) and from the Acute Cardiovascular Care Association (ACVC) and included the experience from the first and worst affected areas in Europe. Modified diagnostic and treatment algorithms are proposed to adapt evidence-based protocols for this unprecedented challenge. Various clinical scenarios, as well as management algorithms for patients with a diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 infection, presenting with ST- and non-ST-segment elevation ACS are described. In addition, we address the need for re-organization of ACS networks, with redistribution of hub and spoke hospitals, as well as for in-hospital reorganization of emergency rooms and cardiac units, with examples coming from multiple European countries. Furthermore, we provide a guidance to reorganization of catheterization laboratories and, importantly, measures for protection of healthcare providers involved with invasive procedures.", "doi":

There is an urgent need for a living, dynamic systematic review that continuously evaluates the beneficial and harmful effects of all available interventions for COVID-19.\n\nWe will conduct a living systematic review based on searches of major medical databases (e.g., MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL) and clinical trial registries from their inception onwards to identify relevant randomized clinical trials. We will update the literature search once a week to continuously assess if new evidence is available. Two review authors will independently extract data and perform risk of bias assessment.

Primary outcomes will be all-cause mortality and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes will be admission to intensive care, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, quality of life, and non-serious adverse events. The living systematic review will include aggregate data meta-analyses, Trial Sequential Analyses, network meta-analysis, and individual patient data meta-analyses. Risk of bias will be assessed with domains, an eight-step procedure will be used to assess if the thresholds for clinical significance are crossed, and the certainty of the evidence will be assessed by Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE).\n\nCOVID-19 has become a pandemic with substantial mortality. A living systematic review evaluating the beneficial and harmful effects of pharmacological and other interventions is urgently needed.

In this original research article, we describe the conception, the analytical and clinical performances as well as the risk management of implementing the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip in a diagnostic decision algorithm. Materials and Methods: Development of the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip resulted in a ready-to-use ICT assay based on a membrane technology with colloidal gold nanoparticles using monoclonal antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highly conserved nucleoprotein antigen. Four hundred observations were recorded for the analytical performance study and thirty tests were analyzed for the cross-reactivity study. The clinical performance study was performed in a retrospective multi-centric evaluation on aliquots of 328 nasopharyngeal samples. COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip results were compared with qRT-PCR as golden standard for COVID-19 diagnostics. Results: In the analytical performance study, the reproducibility showed a between-observer disagreement of 1.7%, a robustness of 98%, an overall satisfying user friendliness and no cross-reactivity with other virus-infected nasopharyngeal samples. In the clinical performance study performed in three different clinical laboratories during the ascendant phase of the epidemiological curve, we found an overall sensitivity and specificity of 57.6 and 99.5%, respectively with an accuracy of 82.6%. The cut-off of the ICT was found at CT <22. User-friendliness analysis and risk management assessment through Ishikawa diagram demonstrate that COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip may be implemented in clinical laboratories according to biosafety recommendations. Conclusion: The COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip represents a promising rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay for the first-line diagnosis of COVID-19 in 15 min at the peak of the pandemic. Its role in the proposed diagnostic algorithm is complementary to the currently-used molecular techniques.", "doi": "10.3389/fmed.2020.00225", "pmid": "32574326", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7227790"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-08T16:17:00.223Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:46:12.913Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "908ed23706424854b3d884aeef134258", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/908ed23706424854b3d884aeef134258.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/908ed23706424854b3d884aeef134258"}}, "title": "The Battle Against COVID-19 in Jordan: An Early Overview of the Jordanian Experience.", "authors": [{"family": "Al-Tammemi", "given": "Ala'a B", "initials": "AB"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-05-07", "journal": {"title": "Front Public Health", "issn": "2296-2565", "volume": "8", "issue": null, "pages": "188", "issn-l": "2296-2565"}, "abstract": "Since the initial spark of the COVID-19 outbreak in December 2019, which was later declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be a global pandemic, all affected countries are implementing various preventive and control measures to mitigate the spread of the disease.

The purpose of this document is to propose technical strategies to assist the pediatric surgeons to minimize the potential aerosolization of viral particles in COVID-19 patients undergoing urgent or emergent surgical treatment using laparoscopic approaches, based on the currently available literature. The situation and recommendations are subject to change with emerging information. Materials and Methods: The Scientific Committee and the Board of the European Society of Pediatric Endoscopic Surgeons gathered together in order to address the issue of minimally invasive surgery during this COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic search through PubMed, Embase, and World Wide Web of the terms \"COVID-19,\" \"Coronavirus,\" and \"SARS-CoV-2\" matched with \"pneumoperitoneum,\" \"laparoscopy,\" \"thoracoscopy,\" \"retroperitoneoscopy,\" and \"surgery\" was performed. Non-English language papers were excluded. A PRISMA report was performed. Criticalities were identified and a consensus was achieved over a number of key aspects. Results: We identified 121 documents. A total of 11 full-text documents were assessed to address all concerns related to the adoption of minimally invasive surgery. All aspect of pediatric minimally invasive surgery, including elective surgery, urgent surgery, laparoscopy, thoracoscopy, retroperitoneoscopy, and pneumoperitoneum creation and maintainance were extensively addressed through systematic review. A consensus regarding urgent laparoscopic procedures, setting and operation techniques was obtained within the Committee and the Board. Conclusions: The ESPES proposes the following recommendations in case minimally invasive surgery is needed in a COVID-19 positive pediatric patients: (1) consider conservative treatment whenever safely possible, (2) dedicate a theater, columns and reusable laparoscopic instrumentation to COVID-19 pediatric patients, (3) prefer disposable instrumentation and cables, (4) use low CO2 insufflation pressures, (5) use low power electrocautery, (6) prefer closed-systems CO2 insufflation and desufflation systems, and (7) avoid leaks through ports.

There is a need to identify key pathogenic molecules in COVID-19-associated inflammation attainable to target with existing therapeutic compounds. The endogenous damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule HMGB1 initiates inflammation via two separate pathways. Disulfide-HMGB1 triggers TLR4 receptors generating pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Extracellular HMGB1, released from dying cells or secreted by activated innate immunity cells, forms complexes with extracellular DNA, RNA and other DAMP or pathogen-associated molecular (DAMP) molecules released after lytic cell death. These complexes are endocytosed via RAGE, constitutively expressed at high levels in the lungs only, and transported to the endolysosomal system, which is disrupted by HMGB1 at high concentrations. Danger molecules thus get access to cytosolic proinflammatory receptors instigating inflammasome activation. It is conceivable that extracellular SARS-CoV-2 RNA may reach the cellular cytosol via HMGB1-assisted transfer combined with lysosome leakage. Extracellular HMGB1 generally exists in vivo bound to other molecules, including PAMPs and DAMPs. It is plausible that these complexes are specifically removed in the lungs revealed by a 40% reduction of HMGB1 plasma levels in arterial versus venous blood. Abundant pulmonary RAGE expression enables endocytosis of danger molecules to be destroyed in the lysosomes at physiological HMGB1 levels, but causing detrimental inflammasome activation at high levels. Stress induces apoptosis in pulmonary endothelial cells from females but necrosis in cells from males.\n\nBased on these observations we propose extracellular HMGB1 to be considered as a therapeutic target for COVID-19.", "doi": "10.1186/s10020-020-00172-4", "pmid": "32380958", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1186/s10020-020-00172-4"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7203545"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-25T07:30:42.009Z", "modified": "2020-12-10T07:37:17.779Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "8f6f511b573945a1be8bb0f50b2f68ad", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/8f6f511b573945a1be8bb0f50b2f68ad.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/8f6f511b573945a1be8bb0f50b2f68ad"}}, "title": "COVID-19: a challenge for oncology services.", "authors": [{"family": "Routy", "given": "Bertrand", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Derosa", "given": "Lisa", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Zitvogel", "given": "Laurence", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Kroemer", "given": "Guido", "initials": "G"}], "type": "editorial", "published": "2020-05-05", "journal": {"title": "Oncoimmunology", "issn": "2162-4011", "volume": "9", "issue": "1", "pages": "1760686", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1080/2162402X.2020.1760686", "pmid": "32923119", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "1760686"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7458620"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-03T15:47:32.730Z", "modified": "2020-12-03T15:47:32.742Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "62b7afd26bb74034adc40ba88cb53b7e", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/62b7afd26bb74034adc40ba88cb53b7e.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/62b7afd26bb74034adc40ba88cb53b7e"}}, "title": "SARS-CoV-2, testosterone and frailty in males (PROTEGGIMI): A multidimensional research project.", "authors": [{"family": "Salonia", "given": "Andrea", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Corona", "given": "Giovanni", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Giwercman", "given": "Aleksander", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Maggi", "given": "Mario", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Minhas", "given": "Suks", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Nappi", "given": "Rossella E", "initials": "RE"}, {"family": "Sofikitis", "given": "Nikolaos", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Vignozzi", "given": "Linda", "initials": "L"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-05-05", "journal": {"title": "Andrology", "issn": "2047-2927", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Preliminary published data depict a much greater prevalence of males with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) referred for intensive care unit admission and severe sequelae in several countries.

Therefore, we may speculate that the different hormonal milieu could have a more profound pathophysiological role in association with SARS-CoV-2, with endogenous testosterone leaving men more prone to develop more serious complications related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or diabetes are at increased risk of severe COVID-19. However, the prevalence of these prognostic factors is unknown in many countries. We aimed to describe the burden and prevalence of prognostic factors of severe COVID-19 at national and county level in Sweden. We calculated the burden and prevalence of prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 based on records from the Swedish national health care and population registers for 3 years before 1st January 2016. 9,624,428 individuals were included in the study population. 22.1% had at least one prognostic factor for severe COVID-19 (2,131,319 individuals), and 1.6% had at least three factors (154,746 individuals). The prevalence of underlying medical conditions ranged from 0.8% with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (78,516 individuals) to 7.4% with cardiovascular disease (708,090 individuals), and the county specific prevalence of at least one prognostic factor ranged from 19.2% in Stockholm (416,988 individuals) to 25.9% in Kalmar (60,005 individuals). We show that one in five individuals in Sweden is at increased risk of severe COVID-19. When compared with the critical care capacity at a local and national level, these results can aid authorities in optimally planning healthcare resources during the current pandemic. Findings can also be applied to underlying assumptions of disease burden in modelling efforts to support COVID-19 planning.", "doi": "10.1007/s10654-020-00646-z", "pmid": "32424571", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1007/s10654-020-00646-z"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7233678"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-25T08:32:29.693Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:46:13.477Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "a25c8dcffb2040b787a0f1d3621f4dce", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/a25c8dcffb2040b787a0f1d3621f4dce.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/a25c8dcffb2040b787a0f1d3621f4dce"}}, "title": "Practice recommendations for lung cancer radiotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic: An ESTRO-ASTRO consensus statement.", "authors": [{"family": "Guckenberger", "given": "Matthias", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Belka", "given": "Claus", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Bezjak", "given": "Andrea", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Bradley", "given": "Jeffrey", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Daly", "given": "Megan E", "initials": "ME"}, {"family": "DeRuysscher", "given": "Dirk", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Dziadziuszko", "given": "Rafal", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Faivre-Finn", "given": "Corinne", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Flentje", "given": "Michael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Gore", "given": "Elizabeth", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Higgins", "given": "Kristin A", "initials": "KA"}, {"family": "Iyengar", "given": "Puneeth", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Kavanagh", "given": "Brian D", "initials": "BD"}, {"family": "Kumar", "given": "Sameera", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Le Pechoux", "given": "Cecile", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Lievens", "given": "Yolande", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Lindberg", "given": "Karin", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "McDonald", "given": "Fiona", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Ramella", "given": "Sara", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Rengan", "given": "Ramesh", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Ricardi", "given": "Umberto", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Rimner", "given": "Andreas", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Rodrigues", "given": "George B", "initials": "GB"}, {"family": "Schild", "given": "Steven E", "initials": "SE"}, {"family": "Senan", "given": "Suresh", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Simone", "given": "Charles B", "initials": "CB 2nd"}, {"family": "Slotman", "given": "Ben J", "initials": "BJ"}, {"family": "Stuschke", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Videtic", "given": "Greg", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Widder", "given": "Joachim", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Yom", "given": "Sue S", "initials": "SS"}, {"family": "Palma", "given": "David", "initials": "D"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-05-00", "journal": {"title": "Radiother Oncol", "issn": "1879-0887", "volume": "146", "issue": null, "pages": "223-229", "issn-l": "0167-8140"}, "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has caused radiotherapy resource pressures and led to increased risks for lung cancer patients and healthcare staff. An international group of experts in lung cancer radiotherapy established this practice recommendation pertaining to whether and how to adapt radiotherapy for lung cancer in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFor this ESTRO & ASTRO endorsed project, 32 experts in lung cancer radiotherapy contributed to a modified Delphi consensus process. We assessed potential adaptations of radiotherapy in two pandemic scenarios. The first, an early pandemic scenario of risk mitigation, is characterized by an altered risk-benefit ratio of radiotherapy for lung cancer patients due to their increased susceptibility for severe COVID-19 infection, and minimization of patient travelling and exposure of radiotherapy staff. The second, a later pandemic scenario, is characterized by reduced radiotherapy resources requiring patient triage. Six common lung cancer cases were assessed for both scenarios: peripherally located stage I NSCLC, locally advanced NSCLC, postoperative radiotherapy after resection of pN2 NSCLC, thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation for limited stage SCLC and palliative thoracic radiotherapy for stage IV NSCLC.\n\nIn a risk-mitigation pandemic scenario, efforts should be made not to compromise the prognosis of lung cancer patients by departing from guideline-recommended radiotherapy practice. In that same scenario, postponement or interruption of radiotherapy treatment of COVID-19 positive patients is generally recommended to avoid exposure of cancer patients and staff to an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. In a severe pandemic scenario characterized by reduced resources, if patients must be triaged, important factors for triage include potential for cure, relative benefit of radiation, life expectancy, and performance status. Case-specific consensus recommendations regarding multimodality treatment strategies and fractionation of radiotherapy are provided.\n\nThis joint ESTRO-ASTRO practice recommendation established pragmatic and balanced consensus recommendations in common clinical scenarios of radiotherapy for lung cancer in order to address the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "doi": "10.1016/j.radonc.2020.04.001", "pmid": "32342863", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0167-8140(20)30182-1"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7252074"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-25T07:13:12.107Z", "modified": "2020-12-10T07:15:35.409Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "915fc7aead7f44f0b92cddf6e2657588", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/915fc7aead7f44f0b92cddf6e2657588.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/915fc7aead7f44f0b92cddf6e2657588"}}, "title": "Management of Advanced Therapies in Parkinson's Disease Patients in Times of Humanitarian Crisis: The COVID-19 Experience.", "authors": [{"family": "Fasano", "given": "Alfonso", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Antonini", "given": "Angelo", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Katzenschlager", "given": "Regina", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Krack", "given": "Paul", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Odin", "given": "Per", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Evans", "given": "Andrew H", "initials": "AH"}, {"family": "Foltynie", "given": "Thomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Volkmann", "given": "Jens", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Merello", "given": "Marcelo", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-05-00", "journal": {"title": "Mov Disord Clin Pract", "issn": "2330-1619", "volume": "7", "issue": "4", "pages": "361-372", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Although the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting a relatively small proportion of the global population, its effects have already reached everyone.

In some regions, the shortage of medical staff has also forced movement disorders neurologists to provide care for patients with COVID-19.\n\nTo share the experience of various movement disorder neurologists operating in different world regions and provide a common approach to patients with PD, with a focus on those already on advanced therapies, which may serve as guidance in the current pandemic and for emergency situations that we may face in the future.\n\nMost of us were unprepared to deal with this condition given that in many health care systems, telemedicine has been only marginally available or only limited to email or telephone contacts. In addition, to ensure sufficient access to intensive care unit beds, most elective procedures (including deep brain stimulation or the initiation of infusion therapies) have been postponed.

hospital visits and admissions and therapy-induced immune-related complications without compromising cancer outcomes. Since COVID-19 is a novel disease, guidance by scientific evidence is often unavailable, and impactful decisions are inevitably made on the basis of expert opinions. Here we report how the seven comprehensive cancer centers of Cancer Core Europe have organized their healthcare systems at an unprecedented scale and pace to make their operations 'pandemic proof'. We identify and discuss many commonalities, but also important local differences, and pinpoint critical research priorities to enable evidence-based remodeling of cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, we discuss how the current situation offers a unique window of opportunity for assessing the effects of de-escalating anticancer regimens, which may fast-forward the development of more-refined and less-toxic treatments. By sharing our joint experiences, we offer a roadmap for proceeding and aim to mobilize the global research community to generate the data that are critically needed to offer the best possible care to patients.", "doi": "10.1038/s41591-020-0874-8", "pmid": "32405058", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1038/s41591-020-0874-8"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-25T08:02:57.207Z", "modified": "2020-11-30T09:07:56.925Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "5506caef258d4d358aebefa4269ad746", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/5506caef258d4d358aebefa4269ad746.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/5506caef258d4d358aebefa4269ad746"}}, "title": "Allergic respiratory disease care in the COVID-19 era: A EUFOREA statement.", "authors": [{"family": "Scadding", "given": "Glenis K", "initials": "GK"}, {"family": "Hellings", "given": "Peter W", "initials": "PW"}, {"family": "Bachert", "given": "Claus", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Bjermer", "given": "Leif", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Diamant", "given": "Zuzana", "initials": "Z"}, {"family": "Gevaert", "given": "Philippe", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Kjeldsen", "given": "Anette", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Kleine-Tebbe", "given": "Jorge", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Klimek", "given": "Ludger", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Muraro", "given": "Antonella", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Roberts", "given": "Graham", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Steinsvik", "given": "Andreas", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Wagenmann", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Wahn", "given": "Ulrich", "initials": "U"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-05-00", "journal": {"title": "World Allergy Organ J", "issn": "1939-4551", "volume": "13", "issue": "5", "pages": "100124", "issn-l": "1939-4551"}, "abstract": "Spring and Summer 2020 are unique in that the challenges of care for those suffering from pollen allergy coincide with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Rift Valley fever, rabies, West Nile, chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Ebola, and influenza viruses among many other viruses have been reported from different African countries. The paucity of information, lack of knowledge, limited resources, and climate change, coupled with cultural traditions make the African continent a hotspot for vector-borne and zoonotic viral diseases, which may spread globally. Currently, there is no information available on the status of virus diseases in Africa. This systematic review highlights the available information about viral diseases, including zoonotic and vector-borne diseases, reported in Africa. The findings will help us understand the trend of emerging and re-emerging virus diseases within the African continent.

More than 100 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are approved or in late stage clinical trials, many of which harness the potent Fc\u03b3R-mediated effector systems to varying degrees. This is most evident for antibodies targeting cancer cells inducing antibody-dependent killing or phagocytosis but is also true to some degree for the mAbs that neutralize or remove small macromolecules such as cytokines or other Igs. The use of mAb therapeutics has also revealed a \"scaffolding\" role for Fc\u03b3R which, in different contexts, may either underpin the therapeutic mAb action such as immune agonism or trigger catastrophic adverse effects. The still unmet therapeutic need in many cancers, inflammatory diseases or emerging infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) requires increased effort on the development of improved and novel mAbs. A more mature appreciation of the immunobiology of individual Fc\u03b3R function and the complexity of the relationships between Fc\u03b3Rs and antibodies is fueling efforts to develop more potent \"next-gen\" therapeutic antibodies. Such development strategies now include focused glycan or protein engineering of the Fc to increase affinity and/or tailor specificity for selective engagement of individual activating Fc\u03b3Rs or the inhibitory Fc\u03b3RIIb or alternatively, for the ablation of Fc\u03b3R interaction altogether. This review touches on recent aspects of Fc\u03b3R and IgG immunobiology and its relationship with the present and future actions of therapeutic mAbs.", "doi": "10.1111/imcb.12326", "pmid": "32157732", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7228307"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-22T09:23:12.446Z", "modified": "2020-11-30T16:01:51.867Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "56b0c4045cd34bcfa299c09a7806480b", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/56b0c4045cd34bcfa299c09a7806480b.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/56b0c4045cd34bcfa299c09a7806480b"}}, "title": "Only strict quarantine measures can curb the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Italy, 2020.", "authors": [{"family": "Sj\u00f6din", "given": "Henrik", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Wilder-Smith", "given": "Annelies", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Osman", "given": "Sarah", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Farooq", "given": "Zia", "initials": "Z"}, {"family": "Rockl\u00f6v", "given": "Joacim", "initials": "J"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-04-00", "journal": {"title": "Euro Surveill", "issn": "1560-7917", "volume": "25", "issue": "13", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Several Italian towns are under lockdown to contain the COVID-19 outbreak.

In the past 20 years, this is the third coronavirus that jumped the species barrier and infected humans. It is highly contagious but associated with low pathogenicity. First identified in Wuhan, China, a city of over 11 million, the disease has since spread to every continent except Antarctica. About 15% to 20% of all cases may be called severe, and it is believed many cases are asymptomatic. The average age of a person with COVID has been reported as 49 years. Worse outcomes are associated with geriatric populations and those with underlying diseases such as cardiovascular, respiratory disorders, and/or diabetes. The coronavirus, like other coronaviruses, is highly contagious and has a latency period of about 14 days. Most patients present with fever and a dry cough, but fever may be absent. Differential diagnosis can be challenging since influenza may present with similar symptoms. Chest radiography or computed tomography may be used to find evidence of secondary pneumonia. Nosocomial infection is of concern, and it has been reported that 3.8% of all cases with COVID-19 in that country involve healthcare workers in China. Most patients have mild disease, and supportive care suffices. A variety of repurposed and investigational drugs are being evaluated. There are currently no antiviral therapies or vaccines, even if many therapies are proposed.

more than 100,000 confirmed infections and 4000 fatalities (as of 10 March 2020). The outbreak has been declared a pandemic by the WHO on Mar 11, 2020. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterise our model for SARS-CoV-2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures, and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.", "doi": "10.4414/smw.2020.20224", "pmid": "32176808", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Category: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "Swiss Med Wkly. 2020;150:w20224"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-17T17:38:57.263Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:46:13.006Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "f4cd5fc5b81b412089e6ad0921ece7a0", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/f4cd5fc5b81b412089e6ad0921ece7a0.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/f4cd5fc5b81b412089e6ad0921ece7a0"}}, "title": "Coronavirus infections: Epidemiological, clinical and immunological features and hypotheses.", "authors": [{"family": "Raoult", "given": "Didier", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Zumla", "given": "Alimuddin", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Locatelli", "given": "Franco", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Ippolito", "given": "Giuseppe", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Kroemer", "given": "Guido", "initials": "G"}], "type": "editorial", "published": "2020-03-02", "journal": {"title": "Cell Stress", "issn": "2523-0204", "volume": "4", "issue": "4", "pages": "66-75", "issn-l": "2523-0204"}, "abstract": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses. Four human CoVs (HCoVs), the non-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like HCoVs (namely HCoV 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1), are globally endemic and account for a substantial fraction of upper respiratory tract infections. Non-SARS-like CoV can occasionally produce severe diseases in frail subjects but do not cause any major (fatal) epidemics. In contrast, SARS like CoVs (namely SARS-CoV and Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, MERS-CoV) can cause intense short-lived fatal outbreaks. The current epidemic caused by the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 and its rapid spread globally is of major concern. There is scanty knowledge on the actual pandemic potential of this new SARS-like virus. It might be speculated that SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is grossly underdiagnosed and that the infection is silently spreading across the globe with two consequences: (i) clusters of severe infections among frail subjects could haphazardly occur linked to unrecognized index cases; (ii) the current epidemic could naturally fall into a low-level endemic phase when a significant number of subjects will have developed immunity. Understanding the role of paucisymptomatic subjects and stratifying patients according to the risk of developing severe clinical presentations is pivotal for implementing reasonable measures to contain the infection and to reduce its mortality. Whilst the future evolution of this epidemic remains unpredictable, classic public health strategies must follow rational patterns. The emergence of yet another global epidemic underscores the permanent challenges that infectious diseases pose and underscores the need for global cooperation and preparedness, even during inter-epidemic periods.", "doi": "10.15698/cst2020.04.216", "pmid": "32292881", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "CST0270E115"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7064018"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-23T11:27:23.267Z", "modified": "2020-12-09T12:09:26.162Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "eea6eb2eee9947eead710b14e91c253a", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/eea6eb2eee9947eead710b14e91c253a.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/eea6eb2eee9947eead710b14e91c253a"}}, "title": "Potential scenarios for the progression of a COVID-19 epidemic in the European Union and the European Economic Area, March 2020.", "authors": [{"family": "Johnson", "given": "Helen C", "initials": "HC"}, {"family": "Gossner", "given": "C\u00e9line M", "initials": "CM"}, {"family": "Colzani", "given": "Edoardo", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Kinsman", "given": "John", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Alexakis", "given": "Leonidas", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Beaut\u00e9", "given": "Julien", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "W\u00fcrz", "given": "Andrea", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Tsolova", "given": "Svetla", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Bundle", "given": "Nick", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Ekdahl", "given": "Karl", "initials": "K"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-03-00", "journal": {"title": "Euro Surveill", "issn": "1560-7917", "volume": "25", "issue": "9", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Two months after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the possibility of established and widespread community transmission in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) is becoming more likely.

Availability of primers/probes, positive controls and personnel were main implementation barriers.", "doi": "10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.6.2000082", "pmid": "32046815", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7029448"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-10T09:07:15.398Z", "modified": "2020-12-10T09:07:15.407Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "3f28068739f0480fb93dab85b6750c3c", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/3f28068739f0480fb93dab85b6750c3c.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/3f28068739f0480fb93dab85b6750c3c"}}, "title": "Latest updates on COVID-19 from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.", "authors": [], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-02-00", "journal": {"title": "Euro Surveill", "issn": "1560-7917", "volume": "25", "issue": "6", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.6.2002131", "pmid": "32070466", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7029450"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-08T06:51:11.110Z", "modified": "2020-12-08T06:51:23.372Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "18a18e7be6c948a69430c431929b1c8c", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/18a18e7be6c948a69430c431929b1c8c.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/18a18e7be6c948a69430c431929b1c8c"}}, "title": "Evaluation of a COVID-19 IgM and IgG rapid test; an efficient tool for assessment of past exposure to SARS-CoV-2", "authors": [{"family": "Hoffman", "given": "Tove", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Nissen", "given": "Karolina", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Krambrich", "given": "Janina", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "R\u00f6nnberg", "given": "Bengt", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Akaberi", "given": "Dario", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Esmaeilzadeh", "given": "Mouna", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Salaneck", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Lindahl", "given": "Johanna", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Lundkvist", "given": "\u00c5ke", "initials": "\u00c5"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2020-01-01", "journal": {"title": "Infect Ecol Epidemiol", "issn": "2000-8686", "issn-l": "2000-8686", "volume": "10", "issue": "1", "pages": "1754538"}, "abstract": "COVID-19 is the most rapidly growing pandemic in modern time, and the need for serological testing is most urgent. Although the diagnostics of acute patients by RT-PCR is both efficient and specific, we are also crucially in need of serological tools for investigating antibody responses and assessing individual and potential herd immunity. We evaluated a commercially available test developed for rapid (within 15 minutes) detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG by 29 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 124 negative controls. The results revealed a sensitivity of 69% and 93.1% for IgM and IgG, respectively, based solely on PCR-positivity due to the absence of a serological gold standard. The assay specificities were shown to be 100% for IgM and 99.2% for IgG. This indicates that the test is suitable for assessing previous virus exposure, although negative results may be unreliable during the first weeks after infection. More detailed studies on antibody responses during and post infection are urgently needed.", "doi": "10.1080/20008686.2020.1754538", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Funder: VR": null, "Category: Imaging": null, "Category: Health": null, "Category: Other": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-04T06:47:15.391Z", "modified": "2021-02-26T08:46:12.946Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "835438bc55a64fd2bab901dcb8287ac4", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/835438bc55a64fd2bab901dcb8287ac4.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/835438bc55a64fd2bab901dcb8287ac4"}}, "title": "Note from the editors: novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).", "authors": [{"family": "Eurosurveillance editorial team", "given": "", "initials": ""}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-01-00", "journal": {"title": "Euro Surveill", "issn": "1560-7917", "volume": "25", "issue": "3", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.3.2001231", "pmid": "31992390", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC6988271"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-10T09:07:13.182Z", "modified": "2020-12-10T09:07:13.192Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "dd5e75653bbc4f49a1f4579c267db46f", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/dd5e75653bbc4f49a1f4579c267db46f.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/dd5e75653bbc4f49a1f4579c267db46f"}}, "title": "COVID-19 and Possible Pharmacological Preventive Options", "authors": [{"family": "Duner", "given": "Pontus", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Salehi", "given": "Albert", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2020-00-00", "journal": {"title": "J Clin Med Res", "issn": "1918-3003", "issn-l": null, "volume": "12", "issue": "12", "pages": "758-772"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.14740/jocmr4383", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2021-01-15T13:08:11.011Z", "modified": "2021-02-05T09:05:35.786Z"}]}
