    "text": "By quantifying K417N and wild-type K417 mutations we estimated the ratio of omicron and delta in major cities. In all places up till Christmas delta was the dominant variant but during the holiday weeks omicron took-over. By the 10th of January delta fall below the detection limit of the assay, indicating outcompeting by omicron.

    "text": "Anna Szekely [shared first results](https://mobile.twitter.com/mikromara/status/1479728491377696769) in work attempting to detect Omicron VoC in Uppsala wastewater samples. Here they are: 'On w51 delta dominated, omicron mutations were barely detectable. On w52 delta continued to increase but omicron also showed a strong signal (probably similar ratio of the 2 variants). On w1 delta started to decrease and omicron more than doubled.' See [Anna Szekely's twitter account](https://mobile.twitter.com/mikromara) for future updates."

During week 49, 21.8% of samples were of the Omicron VoC (out of 565 sequenced samples in total that week)."
